## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Architecture
```
restaurants table:
├── image_url (VARCHAR(2000)) - Primary image for frontend compatibility
└── restaurant_images table:
    ├── restaurant_id (FK)
    ├── image_url (VARCHAR(2000))
    ├── image_order (INT)
    └── created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### 2. Image Scraping Pipeline
- **Source:** Google Places API
- **Processing:** Python scripts with error handling and rate limiting
- **Storage:** Cloudinary with organized folder structure
- **Organization:** `jewgo/restaurants/{restaurant_name}/image_{index}`

### 3. Frontend Integration
- **Next.js Image Optimization:** Configured for Cloudinary domains
- **API Integration:** Backend serves image URLs to frontend
- **Fallback Handling:** Graceful degradation for missing images
