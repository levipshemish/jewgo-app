### **File Type Analysis**
```
Total Files by Type (excluding build artifacts):
- JavaScript: 59,426 files
- TypeScript: 31,005 files  
- Python: 13,291 files

```

### **Major Issues Identified**

#### 1. **Environment Files Scattered Everywhere (CRITICAL)**
**Before**: 20+ environment files across 8+ locations
- Root: `.env`, `.env.local`
- Frontend: Multiple `.env*` files including backups
- Backend: `.env`, `config.env`
- Vercel: `.env.preview.local`
- Config: Multiple templates

**After**: Organized structure with root compliance
```
config/environment/
├── active/           # Current environment files
├── templates/        # Environment templates
└── backups/          # Historical environment files
```

#### 2. **Configuration Files Dispersed**
**Before**: Configuration files scattered across multiple directories
- TOML files in root, backend, tools
- YAML files in multiple locations
- Multiple pyproject.toml files

**After**: Centralized configuration management
```
config/
├── docker/           # Docker Compose files
├── templates/        # Environment templates
├── toml/            # TOML configuration files
├── netlify.toml     # Netlify configuration
├── render.yaml      # Render configuration
├── vercel.json      # Vercel configuration
├── pyproject.toml   # Python project configuration
├── commitlint.config.js  # Commit linting
├── pre-commit-config.yaml # Git hooks
└── ngrok.yml        # Ngrok configuration
```

#### 3. **Documentation Clutter**
**Before**: 20+ documentation files in root directory
**After**: Organized into logical categories in `/docs/`

#### 4. **Script Files Dispersed**
**Before**: Scripts scattered in root and various directories
**After**: Consolidated in `/scripts/` directory
