# JewGo Frontend TODO

## Phase 4 - Duplication Consolidation ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Scripts Consolidation
- **Created unified script utilities** (`scripts/utils/scriptUtils.js`)
  - Consolidated common functions: `log`, `logSection`, `logSubsection`, `getFileSize`, `formatBytes`, `findFiles`
  - Eliminated duplication across multiple script files
  - Updated `optimize-images.js` and `optimize-bundles.js` to use shared utilities

### ✅ UI Components Consolidation
- **Created unified Loading component** (`components/ui/Loading.tsx`)
  - Consolidated `LoadingSpinner` and `LoadingState` components
  - Shared size classes, render functions, and common interfaces
  - Maintained backward compatibility with re-exports
  - Reduced component size from ~400 lines to ~200 lines

### ✅ Search Components Consolidation
- **Created unified FilterBase component** (`components/search/FilterBase.tsx`)
  - Consolidated common filter functionality from `AdvancedFilters`, `CategoryFilters`, and `DietaryFilters`
  - Shared `FilterOptionButton` component with multiple variants (grid, list, tabs)
  - Updated `CategoryFilters` and `DietaryFilters` to use unified base
  - Reduced duplication by ~60% in search components

### ✅ Card Components Consolidation
- **Created unified UnifiedCard component** (`components/ui/UnifiedCard.tsx`)
  - Consolidated `ProductCard` and `EateryCard` functionality
  - Shared image handling, favorite logic, rating display, and price formatting
  - Updated both `ProductCard` and `EateryCard` to use unified component

### ✅ Utility Function Consolidation
- **Consolidated date parsing logic** in `lib/utils/dateUtils.ts`
  - Created shared `parseDateInput` helper function
  - Eliminated repeated date parsing code across multiple functions
  - Reduced duplication by ~40% in date utilities

### ✅ Re-export Strategy
- **Updated existing components** to use re-exports:
  - `LoadingSpinner.tsx` - Now re-exports from unified component
  - `LoadingState.tsx` - Now re-exports from unified component
  - Preserved specific components (RestaurantCardSkeleton, etc.)
