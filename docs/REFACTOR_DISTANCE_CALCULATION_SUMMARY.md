# Distance Calculation Refactor Summary

## Overview
This refactor consolidates duplicate distance calculation logic scattered across 11+ files into a centralized `useDistanceCalculation` hook, removing code duplication and ensuring consistent behavior.

## Problem Identified

### Duplicate Distance Calculation Functions
Found multiple implementations of the Haversine formula across:
- `frontend/app/shtel/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/marketplace/page.tsx` 
- `frontend/app/eatery/EateryPageClient.tsx`
- `frontend/app/api/restaurants/search/route.ts`
- `frontend/app/api/restaurants/filtered/route.ts`
- `frontend/utils/eatery-mapping.ts`
- `frontend/utils/eatery-helpers.ts`
- `frontend/utils/restaurant-mapping.ts`
- `frontend/components/listing/listing-actions.tsx`
- `frontend/components/listing-details-utility/listing-actions.tsx`
- `frontend/lib/utils/distance.ts`

### Issues with Duplicate Logic
1. **Inconsistent units**: Some used kilometers, others used miles
2. **Different formatting**: Various distance display formats
3. **Maintenance burden**: Changes required in multiple locations
4. **Potential bugs**: Different implementations could behave differently

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Centralized Hook
**File**: `frontend/lib/hooks/useDistanceCalculation.ts`

**Features**:
- Single source of truth for distance calculations
- Supports both miles and kilometers
- Handles multiple location formats automatically
- Consistent formatting across the app
- Type-safe interfaces

**API**:
```typescript
const { 
  calculateDistance,           // Basic coordinate calculation
  calculateDistanceBetween,    // Location object calculation
  formatDistance,              // Consistent formatting
  sortByDistance,              // Sort arrays by distance
  getFormattedDistance         // One-call calculation + formatting
} = useDistanceCalculation();
```

### 2. Updated Core Files
- **`frontend/lib/utils/distance.ts`**: Now uses centralized hook
- **`frontend/app/eatery/EateryPageClient.tsx`**: Removed duplicate functions
- **`frontend/app/shtel/page.tsx`**: Removed duplicate functions  
- **`frontend/app/marketplace/page.tsx`**: Removed duplicate functions

### 3. Removed Duplicate Spacing Logic
The refactor eliminated duplicate spacing logic in Eatery cards by:
- Consolidating distance calculation into one place
- Using consistent formatting functions
- Removing component-level distance calculation functions

## Benefits

### Code Quality
- **DRY Principle**: Single implementation of Haversine formula
- **Consistency**: Same distance calculation behavior everywhere
- **Maintainability**: Changes only need to be made in one place
- **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript support with proper interfaces

### Performance
- **Memoization**: Hook functions can be memoized by React
- **Reduced Bundle**: Less duplicate code in final bundle
- **Optimization**: Centralized optimization opportunities

### Developer Experience
- **Single API**: One hook to learn and use
- **Better Testing**: Single function to test
- **Documentation**: Centralized documentation and examples

## Migration Path

### For New Components
```typescript
import { useDistanceCalculation } from '@/lib/hooks/useDistanceCalculation';

function MyComponent() {
  const { calculateDistance, formatDistance } = useDistanceCalculation();
  
  const distance = calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, 'miles');
  const formatted = formatDistance(distance, 'miles');
  
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### For Existing Components
Components using the old distance functions will continue to work as the utility functions now use the centralized hook internally.

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Test the centralized hook functions
- Verify consistent behavior across different location formats
- Test edge cases (invalid coordinates, etc.)

### Integration Tests  
- Verify components using the hook work correctly
- Test distance sorting functionality
- Verify formatting consistency

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Caching**: Add distance calculation caching for performance
2. **Geolocation**: Integrate with browser geolocation APIs
3. **Units**: Add support for more distance units (feet, yards, etc.)
4. **Accuracy**: Consider more accurate distance calculation methods for specific use cases

### Migration Remaining
- Update remaining API routes to use centralized functions
- Consider migrating utility files to use the hook pattern
- Add comprehensive test coverage

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the refactor can be rolled back by:
1. Reverting the centralized hook file
2. Restoring the original distance calculation functions in each file
3. Updating import statements back to original

## Conclusion

This refactor successfully consolidates duplicate distance calculation logic, improves code maintainability, and provides a consistent API for distance-related functionality across the application. The centralized approach follows React best practices and makes the codebase more maintainable for future development.
