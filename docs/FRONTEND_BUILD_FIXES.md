### 6. Server Action Architecture Issues

#### Problem
Server actions with `revalidatePath` cannot be imported in client components, causing build failures.

#### Solution
Created client-side versions of server actions:

**Update Profile Actions**
- **Server**: `frontend/app/actions/update-profile.ts`
- **Client**: `frontend/app/actions/update-profile-client.ts`
- **Usage**: Components now use client-side versions that make API calls

**Upload Avatar Actions**
- **Server**: `frontend/app/actions/upload-avatar.ts`
- **Client**: `frontend/app/actions/upload-avatar-client.ts`
- **Usage**: Avatar upload components use client-side versions

### 7. Missing "use client" Directives

#### Fixed Files
- `frontend/app/notifications/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/profile/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/profile/settings/page.tsx`

#### Issue
Next.js 13+ App Router requires `"use client"` directive for components using React hooks.

#### Solution
Added `"use client"` directive to all client-side page components.

### 8. Type Errors Fixed

#### Admin Types
**File**: `frontend/lib/admin/types.ts`
- **Issue**: Malformed comment syntax causing TypeScript errors
- **Fix**: Corrected comment structure and interface declarations

#### Admin Database Service
**File**: `frontend/lib/admin/database.ts`
- **Issue**: Missing `getHealthStatus` method
- **Fix**: Added method as alias for existing `healthCheck` method

### 9. Syntax Errors Fixed

#### Common Patterns Fixed
- Interface declarations with missing opening braces
- Function parameter destructuring syntax errors
- JSX syntax errors in component returns
- Import/export statement issues
- Comment syntax errors
