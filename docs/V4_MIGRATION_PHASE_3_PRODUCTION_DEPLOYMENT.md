- Performance metrics stable

### Step 3: Increase to 50% Rollout
**Timeline**: After 25% success (48-72 hours)
**Action**: Monitor with majority user base
**Success Criteria**:
- Error rate < 2%
- Response time < 600ms
- No critical alerts
- All metrics within thresholds

### Step 4: Increase to 100% Rollout
**Timeline**: After 50% success (72-96 hours)
**Action**: Full production deployment
**Success Criteria**:
- Error rate < 1%
- Response time < 500ms
- No critical alerts
- Complete migration success

3. **Critical Alerts**: Emergency rollback to 0%
4. **System Health = false**: Automatic rollback

### Manual Rollback Commands
```bash
# Emergency rollback to 0%
python scripts/migration/gradual_rollout_manager.py --action force --percentage 0

# Rollback to specific percentage
python scripts/migration/gradual_rollout_manager.py --action force --percentage 10

# Disable all v4 features
python -c "from utils.feature_flags_v4 import rollback_migration; rollback_migration()"
```
