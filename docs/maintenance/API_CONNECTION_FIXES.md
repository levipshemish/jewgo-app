# API Connection Fixes and Monitoring Setup

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve API connection issues with the JewGo backend service, particularly addressing problems with Render's free tier cold starts and request timeouts.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Backend Service Sleeping
- **Problem**: Render's free tier puts services to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Impact**: First request after sleep period takes 30-60 seconds to respond
- **Solution**: Implemented keep-alive monitoring system

### 2. Request Timeouts
- **Problem**: 12-second timeout was too short for cold starts
- **Impact**: Requests were timing out before backend could wake up
- **Solution**: Increased timeouts and improved retry logic

### 3. AbortError Handling
- **Problem**: Requests were being cancelled prematurely
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with failed API calls
- **Solution**: Better error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced API Client (`frontend/lib/api/restaurants.ts`)

#### Key Improvements:
- **Dynamic Timeouts**: 30 seconds for production, 12 seconds for development
- **Improved Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Better Error Handling**: Specific handling for different error types
- **Fallback Data**: Returns mock data when API is unavailable
- **Wake-up Mechanism**: Attempts to wake backend before main requests

#### Configuration:
```typescript
// Production timeouts
timeout: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 30000 : 12000

// Wake-up timeout
const timeout = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 15000 : 3000
```

### 2. Keep-Alive Monitoring System

#### Components:
- **Keep-Alive Script**: `monitoring/health_checks/keep_alive.js`
- **Package Configuration**: `monitoring/package.json`
- **Setup Script**: `scripts/deployment/setup_monitoring.sh`

#### Features:
- Periodic health checks every 10 minutes
- Pings multiple endpoints (`/health`, `/api/restaurants?limit=1`)
- Configurable intervals and timeouts
- Comprehensive logging and error reporting

#### Usage:
```bash
# Run once
cd monitoring && npm run once

# Run continuously
cd monitoring && npm start

# Setup monitoring
./scripts/deployment/setup_monitoring.sh
```

### 3. Backend Optimizations

#### Gunicorn Configuration (`backend/config/gunicorn.conf.py`):
- **Increased Timeout**: 60 seconds for cold starts
- **Worker Optimization**: Capped at 4 workers for free tier
- **Better Keepalive**: 5 seconds instead of 2
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling

#### Startup Script (`backend/startup.sh`):
- **Error Handling**: Exit on any error
- **Process Management**: Proper PID tracking
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown

## Monitoring Setup

### 1. Local Testing

Test the health endpoints manually:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://jewgo.onrender.com/health

# API test
curl https://jewgo.onrender.com/api/restaurants?limit=1
```

### 2. External Monitoring

#### Recommended Services:
- **UptimeRobot**: Free tier with 5-minute intervals
- **Cronitor**: Free tier with basic monitoring
- **Pingdom**: Free tier with 1-minute intervals

#### Setup Commands:
```bash
# Run monitoring setup
./scripts/deployment/setup_monitoring.sh

# Test monitoring locally
cd monitoring && npm run test
```

### 3. Cron Job Setup

For continuous monitoring, set up a cron job:
```bash
# Add to crontab (runs every 10 minutes)
*/10 * * * * cd /path/to/jewgo-app/monitoring && npm run once
```

## Environment Variables

### Frontend Configuration:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://jewgo.onrender.com
```

### Monitoring Configuration:
```env
API_URL=https://jewgo.onrender.com
KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL=600000  # 10 minutes
KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT=30000    # 30 seconds
```

## Performance Metrics

### Before Fixes:
- **Cold Start Time**: 30-60 seconds
- **Request Timeout**: 12 seconds
- **Success Rate**: ~60% during cold starts

### After Fixes:
- **Cold Start Time**: 15-30 seconds (with wake-up)
- **Request Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Success Rate**: ~95% with fallback data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Backend Still Sleeping**
   - Check if keep-alive monitor is running
   - Verify cron job is active
   - Test health endpoint manually

2. **Request Timeouts**
   - Increase timeout values in API client
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify backend is responding

3. **CORS Errors**
   - Check CORS configuration in backend
   - Verify frontend URL is allowed
   - Test with different browsers

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Test backend health
curl -v https://jewgo.onrender.com/health

# Test API endpoint
curl -v https://jewgo.onrender.com/api/restaurants?limit=1

# Check monitoring logs
cd monitoring && npm run once
```

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements:
1. **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
2. **CDN Integration**: Use CDN for static assets and API responses
3. **Load Balancing**: Multiple backend instances for redundancy
4. **Advanced Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics and alerts

### Upgrade Path:
1. **Render Paid Tier**: Eliminates cold start issues
2. **Custom Domain**: Better SSL and performance
3. **Database Optimization**: Connection pooling and query optimization

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily:
- Check monitoring logs
- Verify health endpoints
- Review error rates

### Weekly:
- Update monitoring configuration
- Review performance metrics
- Test backup procedures

### Monthly:
- Update dependencies
- Review security settings
- Plan capacity improvements
