# Certifying Agency Frontend Fix

## Issue Identified

The add eatery pages were showing certifying agency options that don't exist in the database:

### 🔍 **Problem**
- **Database**: Only contains "ORB" and "Kosher Miami" agencies
- **Frontend**: Was showing 4 options including "KM" and "Other" that don't exist
- **User Experience**: Users could select agencies that aren't actually used in the system

### 🎯 **Root Cause**
The frontend filter-options endpoint had hardcoded fallback values that included outdated agency options:
- `'KM'` - Abbreviation for Kosher Miami (redundant)
- `'Other'` - Generic option that doesn't exist in database

## Files Fixed

### 1. Frontend API Route
**File**: `frontend/app/api/restaurants/filter-options/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Removed `'KM'` and `'Other'` from fallback agencies array
- Now only returns `['ORB', 'Kosher Miami']` when backend is unavailable

### 2. Enhanced Add Eatery Form
**File**: `frontend/components/forms/EnhancedAddEateryForm.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Updated default filter options to only include existing agencies
- Removed `'KM'` from fallback agencies array

### 3. Agency Filters Component
**File**: `frontend/components/search/AgencyFilters.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed `'KM'` option from the AGENCIES constant
- Now only shows "ORB" and "Kosher Miami" options

## Before vs After

### Before
```typescript
agencies: [
  'ORB',
  'Kosher Miami',
  'KM',        // ← Removed
  'Other'      // ← Removed
]
```

### After
```typescript
agencies: [
  'ORB',
  'Kosher Miami'
]
```

## Impact

### ✅ **Positive Changes**
- **Consistency**: Frontend now matches database state exactly
- **User Experience**: Users can only select valid agencies
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents submission of invalid agency values
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain with fewer options

### 🔄 **No Breaking Changes**
- Existing restaurants with "ORB" and "Kosher Miami" are unaffected
- All existing functionality remains intact
- No database changes required

## Verification

### Database Check
```bash
python scripts/maintenance/check_certifying_agencies.py
```
**Result**: ✅ Only "ORB" and "Kosher Miami" exist in database

### Frontend Check
The add eatery form now only shows:
- ✅ ORB
- ✅ Kosher Miami
- ❌ ~~KM~~ (removed)
- ❌ ~~Other~~ (removed)

## Recommendations

### 🔄 **Ongoing Maintenance**
1. **Regular Audits**: Run certifying agency checks monthly
2. **Frontend-Backend Sync**: Ensure frontend options always match database state
3. **Validation**: Add server-side validation to reject invalid agency submissions

### 📊 **Future Considerations**
- If new agencies are added to the database, update frontend fallback values
- Consider making the frontend dynamically fetch agency options from database
- Add validation to prevent submission of non-existent agencies

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/app/api/restaurants/filter-options/route.ts`
2. `frontend/components/forms/EnhancedAddEateryForm.tsx`
3. `frontend/components/search/AgencyFilters.tsx`
