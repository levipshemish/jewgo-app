# React Error #310 Fix Summary

## Issue Description
**Error**: `Minified React error #310; visit https://react.dev/errors/310 for the full message`

**Location**: `frontend/app/add-eatery/page.tsx`

**Impact**: Critical - Caused application crashes when users tried to access the add-eatery page

## Root Cause
The error was caused by a **React Hooks violation** where hooks were being called conditionally. Specifically:

1. `useGuestProtection` and `useRouter` hooks were called
2. `useState(1)` was called
3. **Early returns happened** (if loading or guest)
4. **More hooks were called after the early returns** (useState, useEffect, etc.)

This violated the **Rules of Hooks**, which state that:
- Hooks must always be called in the same order
- Hooks cannot be called conditionally
- Hooks must be called at the top level of React functions

## Solution
Restructured the component to call **all hooks at the top** before any conditional logic:

```typescript
export default function AddEateryPage() {
  // ALL HOOKS CALLED FIRST
  const { isLoading, isGuest } = useGuestProtection('/add-eatery');
  const router = useRouter();
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1);
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const [filterOptions, setFilterOptions] = useState<FilterOptions>({...});
  const [validationErrors, setValidationErrors] = useState<{[key: string]: string}>({});
  const [isValidating, setIsValidating] = useState(false);
  const [requiredFieldErrors, setRequiredFieldErrors] = useState<{[key: string]: string}>({});
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<FormData>({...});

  // useEffect called after all useState hooks
  useEffect(() => {
    // ... fetch filter options
  }, []);

  // CONDITIONAL RETURNS AFTER ALL HOOKS
  if (isLoading) {
    return <LoadingComponent />;
  }

  if (isGuest) {
    return <GuestRestrictedComponent />;
  }

  // Rest of component logic...
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ **Build successful**: `npm run build` completes without errors
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation**: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- ✅ **Runtime testing**: Page loads without React errors
- ✅ **Authentication flow**: Proper redirects work as expected

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always call hooks at the top** of React components
2. **Never call hooks after conditional returns**
3. **Use ESLint rules** for React Hooks to catch violations early
4. **Follow the Rules of Hooks** strictly:
   - Only call hooks at the top level
   - Only call hooks from React functions
   - Call hooks in the same order every time

## Files Modified
- `frontend/app/add-eatery/page.tsx` - Fixed hooks order
