# Thread Safety Fix for In-Memory Caching

## Issue Description

The `backend/app_factory.py` file was using non-thread-safe global dictionaries for in-memory caching:

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE (REMOVED)
_restaurant_cache = {}
_cache_timestamps = {}
CACHE_DURATION = 300  # 5 minutes in seconds
```

This approach had several critical issues:

1. **Thread Safety**: Global dictionaries are not thread-safe and can cause race conditions in multi-worker deployments
2. **Memory Leaks**: No proper cleanup mechanism could lead to memory leaks over time
3. **Inconsistent State**: Different worker processes would have separate cache instances, leading to inconsistent data
4. **No Persistence**: Cache data was lost when workers restarted

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Replaced Global Dictionaries with CacheManager

The fix replaces the global dictionaries with the existing `CacheManager` class that provides:

- **Thread-safe operations** through proper locking mechanisms
- **Redis-based caching** with fallback to in-memory storage
- **Automatic TTL management** to prevent memory leaks
- **Consistent state** across all worker processes when using Redis
- **Proper error handling** and graceful degradation

### 2. Updated Caching Functions

```python
# NEW THREAD-SAFE IMPLEMENTATION
def get_cached_restaurants(cache_key: str):
    """Get cached restaurant data using the thread-safe CacheManager."""
    try:
        from utils.cache_manager import cache_manager
        return cache_manager.get(cache_key)
    except Exception:
        # Fallback to None if cache manager is not available
        return None

def set_cached_restaurants(cache_key: str, data: Any):
    """Cache restaurant data using the thread-safe CacheManager."""
    try:
        from utils.cache_manager import cache_manager
        cache_manager.set(cache_key, data, ttl=300)  # 5 minutes TTL
    except Exception:
        # Silently fail if cache manager is not available
        pass
```

## Benefits of the Fix

### 1. Thread Safety
- Eliminates race conditions in multi-worker deployments
- Safe concurrent access to cached data
- Proper synchronization mechanisms

### 2. Memory Management
- Automatic expiration of cached data (TTL)
- No memory leaks from uncleaned cache entries
- Efficient memory usage with Redis backend

### 3. Scalability
- Shared cache across all worker processes when using Redis
- Consistent data across the entire application
- Better performance in high-traffic scenarios

### 4. Reliability
- Graceful fallback to in-memory cache if Redis is unavailable
- Proper error handling without crashing the application
- Maintains functionality even during cache failures

### 5. Monitoring and Debugging
- Better observability through CacheManager's logging
- Cache statistics and monitoring capabilities
- Easier debugging of cache-related issues

## Deployment Impact

### Multi-Worker Deployments
- **Before**: Each worker had its own cache instance, leading to inconsistent data and potential race conditions
- **After**: All workers share the same cache (Redis) or have thread-safe local caches

### Memory Usage
- **Before**: Potential memory leaks from uncleaned global dictionaries
- **After**: Automatic cleanup and efficient memory management

### Performance
- **Before**: Cache misses due to worker restarts and inconsistent state
- **After**: Persistent cache across worker restarts and consistent performance

## Configuration

The fix automatically uses the existing Redis configuration:

```python
# Uses existing environment variables
REDIS_URL = os.environ.get("REDIS_URL")
cache_manager = CacheManager(redis_url=REDIS_URL, default_ttl=300)
```

## Testing

The fix maintains backward compatibility and includes proper error handling:

1. **Redis Available**: Uses Redis for shared, persistent caching
2. **Redis Unavailable**: Falls back to thread-safe in-memory caching
3. **Cache Manager Unavailable**: Gracefully degrades to no caching

## Monitoring

Monitor the following metrics after deployment:

1. **Cache Hit Rates**: Should improve with shared Redis cache
2. **Memory Usage**: Should be more stable without memory leaks
3. **Response Times**: Should be more consistent across workers
4. **Error Rates**: Should decrease due to eliminated race conditions

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:

1. **Cache Warming**: Pre-populate cache on application startup
2. **Cache Invalidation**: More sophisticated invalidation strategies
3. **Cache Analytics**: Detailed cache performance metrics
4. **Distributed Locking**: For cache updates in high-concurrency scenarios
