# Certifying Agency "Other" Option Implementation

## Overview

Added "Other" as a certifying agency option with a custom text input field, allowing users to specify agencies that aren't in the standard list while maintaining data integrity.

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Updates
**File**: `frontend/lib/validations/restaurant-form-schema.ts`

**Added**:
- `custom_certifying_agency` field to the main schema
- Conditional validation to require custom agency name when "Other" is selected
- Updated step2Schema with the same validation
- Added field to defaultFormData

### 2. Frontend API Route
**File**: `frontend/app/api/restaurants/filter-options/route.ts`

**Updated**:
- Added "Other" back to the agencies array in fallback options
- Now returns: `['ORB', 'Kosher Miami', 'Other']`

### 3. Enhanced Add Eatery Form
**File**: `frontend/components/forms/EnhancedAddEateryForm.tsx`

**Added**:
- `watchedCertifyingAgency` to track the selected agency
- Conditional text input field that appears when "Other" is selected
- Form submission logic to use custom agency name when "Other" is selected
- Updated preview to show custom agency name
- Added `custom_certifying_agency` to step 2 validation fields

### 4. Form Validation
**Enhanced validation**:
- When "Other" is selected, `custom_certifying_agency` becomes required
- Custom agency name must be 100 characters or less
- Form submission automatically uses the custom name instead of "Other"

## User Experience

### Before
- Users could only select from predefined agencies
- No flexibility for unique or regional certifying agencies

### After
- Users can select from standard agencies: ORB, Kosher Miami
- Users can select "Other" and specify a custom agency name
- Custom agency name is required when "Other" is selected
- Form preview shows the actual custom agency name

## Form Flow

1. **User selects certifying agency**:
   - ORB
   - Kosher Miami
   - Other

2. **If "Other" is selected**:
   - Additional text input appears
   - User must enter the agency name
   - Validation ensures the field is not empty

3. **Form submission**:
   - If "Other" + custom name: submits the custom name
   - If standard agency: submits the standard name

4. **Preview**:
   - Shows the actual agency name (custom or standard)

## Data Integrity

### Validation Rules
- `custom_certifying_agency` is optional unless "Other" is selected
- Maximum length: 100 characters
- Required when "Other" is selected
- Automatically used in place of "Other" during submission

### Database Impact
- No database schema changes required
- Custom agency names are stored in the existing `certifying_agency` field
- Maintains compatibility with existing data

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/lib/validations/restaurant-form-schema.ts`
2. `frontend/app/api/restaurants/filter-options/route.ts`
3. `frontend/components/forms/EnhancedAddEateryForm.tsx`

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Valid Submissions
- Select "ORB" → Submit → Agency: "ORB"
- Select "Kosher Miami" → Submit → Agency: "Kosher Miami"
- Select "Other" + Enter "Star-K" → Submit → Agency: "Star-K"

### ❌ Invalid Submissions
- Select "Other" + Empty field → Validation error
- Select "Other" + 101+ characters → Validation error

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Accommodates various certifying agencies
2. **Data Quality**: Maintains structured data while allowing custom entries
3. **User Experience**: Clear interface with conditional fields
4. **Validation**: Ensures data completeness and quality
5. **Compatibility**: Works with existing database structure
