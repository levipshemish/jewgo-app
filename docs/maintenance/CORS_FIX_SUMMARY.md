# CORS Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The frontend application at `https://jewgo.app` was experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to access the backend API at `https://jewgo.onrender.com`. The error message was:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://jewgo.onrender.com/api/restaurants?limit=1000' from origin 'https://jewgo.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause
The backend CORS configuration was not properly set up to allow requests from the production frontend domain `https://jewgo.app`. The configuration was hardcoded in the app factory but didn't include the correct production domain, and the environment variable `CORS_ORIGINS` was not set in the Render deployment configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Backend CORS Configuration (`backend/app_factory.py`)
- Modified the CORS configuration to read from environment variables first
- Added fallback to default origins if environment variable is not set
- Enhanced the OPTIONS handler to properly handle preflight requests with correct origin headers

### 2. Updated Render Deployment Configuration (`render.yaml`)
- Added `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable with the following allowed origins:
  - `https://jewgo.app` (production frontend)
  - `https://jewgo-app.vercel.app` (staging frontend)
  - `http://localhost:3000` (local development)
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (local development)

## Technical Details

### CORS Configuration Logic
```python
# Get CORS origins from environment or use defaults
cors_origins = os.environ.get("CORS_ORIGINS", "").split(",") if os.environ.get("CORS_ORIGINS") else []

# Add default origins if not specified in environment
if not cors_origins or cors_origins == [""]:
    cors_origins = [
        "https://jewgo.app",
        "https://jewgo-app.vercel.app", 
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
    ]
```

### OPTIONS Handler Enhancement
The OPTIONS handler now properly validates the request origin and sets the appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header based on the allowed origins list.

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed to main branch
- ✅ Render will automatically deploy the updated configuration
- ✅ Environment variable `CORS_ORIGINS` will be set in production

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Verify CORS Headers**: Check that the backend now returns proper CORS headers for requests from `https://jewgo.app`
2. **Test Preflight Requests**: Ensure OPTIONS requests are handled correctly
3. **Monitor API Calls**: Verify that the live-map page can now successfully fetch restaurant data
4. **Check Browser Console**: Confirm no CORS errors appear in the browser developer tools

## Security Considerations
- The CORS configuration is now properly scoped to specific allowed origins
- Credentials are supported for authenticated requests
- Preflight requests are cached for 24 hours to improve performance
- The configuration supports both development and production environments

## Future Maintenance
- When adding new frontend domains, update the `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable in `render.yaml`
- Consider implementing a more dynamic CORS configuration if the list of allowed origins grows significantly
- Monitor CORS-related errors in production logs to catch any configuration issues early
