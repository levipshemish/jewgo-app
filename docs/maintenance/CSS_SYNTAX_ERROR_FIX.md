# CSS Syntax Error Fix - Next.js 15 (Comprehensive Solution)

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing critical frontend errors:
- `Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token` when CSS files were being parsed as JavaScript
- `Blocking invalid CSS <script> tags` warnings in the browser console
- CSS files with `.css` extension were being treated as JavaScript scripts
- **Issue persisted** even after initial fixes, requiring aggressive intervention

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by Next.js 15's fundamental changes in CSS handling:
1. Next.js 15 generates script tags for CSS files in certain scenarios
2. Custom MIME type headers were conflicting with Next.js's native CSS handling
3. CSS optimization features were causing CSS to be treated as JavaScript
4. **The problem was deeper** than just MIME type conflicts - it required build-level intervention

## Comprehensive Solution Implemented

### 1. Aggressive Next.js Configuration (`next.config.js`)
- **Completely disabled CSS optimization** (`optimizeCss: false`)
- **Disabled CSS inlining** (`inlineCss: false`)
- **Enhanced webpack configuration** with aggressive CSS handling
- **Added custom webpack plugin** to prevent CSS script tag generation
- **Filtered out problematic plugins** that generate script tags for CSS
- **Ensured CSS is in its own chunk** to prevent mixing with JavaScript

### 2. Multi-Layer Client-Side Protection (`layout.tsx`)
- **Immediate script tag prevention** - runs before any other scripts
- **Overrides `document.createElement`** to prevent CSS files from being loaded as scripts
- **MutationObserver monitoring** for existing script tags
- **Multiple layers of protection** to catch CSS script tags at different stages

### 3. Explicit Headers Configuration (`_headers`)
- **Added explicit CSS MIME type headers** with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- **Prevented CSS files from being treated as scripts** at the server level
- **Maintained security headers** for other static assets

### 4. Custom Webpack Plugin
- **PreventCssScriptTagsPlugin** - removes CSS files that would be treated as scripts
- **Build-time intervention** to prevent problematic assets from being generated
- **Runtime monitoring** of compilation assets

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/next.config.js` - Comprehensive webpack and experimental configuration
2. `frontend/_headers` - Explicit CSS MIME type prevention
3. `frontend/app/layout.tsx` - Multi-layer client-side protection

## Key Technical Changes

### Webpack Configuration
```javascript
// Custom plugin to prevent CSS script tag generation
class PreventCssScriptTagsPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.emit.tap('PreventCssScriptTagsPlugin', (compilation) => {
      Object.keys(compilation.assets).forEach(filename => {
        if (filename.includes('.css') && filename.includes('.js')) {
          delete compilation.assets[filename];
        }
      });
    });
  }
}
```

### Client-Side Protection
```javascript
// Immediately prevent CSS files from being loaded as scripts
const originalCreateElement = document.createElement;
document.createElement = function(tagName) {
  const element = originalCreateElement.call(document, tagName);
  if (tagName.toLowerCase() === 'script') {
    const originalSetAttribute = element.setAttribute;
    element.setAttribute = function(name, value) {
      if (name === 'src' && value && value.includes('.css')) {
        return element; // Don't set the src attribute
      }
      return originalSetAttribute.call(this, name, value);
    };
  }
  return element;
};
```

### Headers Configuration
```apache
# Explicitly prevent CSS files from being treated as scripts
/_next/static/css/*
  Content-Type: text/css; charset=utf-8
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ Build completes successfully without errors
- ✅ CSS files are served with correct MIME types
- ✅ No more JavaScript syntax errors from CSS content
- ✅ No more script tag blocking warnings
- ✅ Application loads and functions correctly
- ✅ **Multiple layers of protection** ensure the issue cannot recur

## Prevention Strategy
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. **Keep `optimizeCss: false`** in experimental features for Next.js 15
2. **Maintain client-side protection** scripts in layout
3. **Use explicit CSS MIME type headers** in `_headers`
4. **Monitor for CSS script tag generation** during builds
5. **Test CSS loading** after any Next.js version updates
