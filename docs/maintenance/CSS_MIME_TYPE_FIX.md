# CSS MIME Type Fix

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing a JavaScript syntax error: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '.'` when CSS content (specifically Leaflet CSS) was being parsed as JavaScript. This is a common issue in Next.js applications when CSS files are not properly handled or when there are MIME type issues.

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:
1. CSS files were being served with incorrect MIME types
2. The browser was trying to parse CSS content as JavaScript
3. Leaflet CSS was being imported in a way that caused MIME type confusion

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Next.js Configuration (`next.config.js`)
- Added comprehensive MIME type headers for CSS files
- Added `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` headers to prevent MIME type sniffing
- Enhanced static asset handling with proper content types

### 2. Improved CSS Loading Strategy
- Removed direct CSS import from `layout.tsx`
- Created a dynamic CSS loader component (`CssLoader.tsx`)
- Implemented fallback CSS loading mechanism
- Added error handling for CSS loading failures

### 3. Enhanced CSS File (`leaflet.css`)
- Removed problematic `@import` statement
- Added direct CSS content to prevent import-related issues
- Included essential Leaflet styles without external dependencies

### 4. Added Client-Side Protection
- Implemented JavaScript monitoring for CSS loading issues
- Added protection against CSS files being loaded as scripts
- Created mutation observer to detect and prevent problematic script tags

### 5. Created Test Page
- Added `/test-css` page to verify CSS loading functionality
- Implemented error monitoring and status reporting
- Created visual test for Leaflet container styling

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/next.config.js` - Enhanced MIME type handling
2. `frontend/app/layout.tsx` - Updated CSS loading approach
3. `frontend/app/leaflet.css` - Removed imports, added direct content
4. `frontend/components/ui/CssLoader.tsx` - New dynamic CSS loader
5. `frontend/app/test-css/page.tsx` - Test page for verification

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Visit `/test-css` page
2. Check browser console for any CSS-related errors
3. Verify that Leaflet containers render properly
4. Monitor for any MIME type warnings

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use proper MIME type headers for static assets
2. Avoid mixing CSS imports with JavaScript imports
3. Use dynamic CSS loading for external libraries
4. Implement proper error handling for asset loading
5. Monitor browser console for MIME type warnings

## Performance Impact

The solution has minimal performance impact:
- CSS is loaded dynamically only when needed
- Fallback mechanisms ensure graceful degradation
- No additional network requests for CSS that's already loaded
- Proper caching headers maintain performance
