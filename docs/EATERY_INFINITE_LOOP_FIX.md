# Eatery Page Infinite Loop Fix

## Problem Summary

The eatery page was experiencing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error, which typically happens when there's an infinite loop in useEffect dependencies or setState calls. This was causing the page to continuously refetch data and re-render.

## Root Cause Analysis

The infinite loop was caused by several interconnected issues:

1. **Unstable Dependencies**: Some useEffect dependencies were changing on every render
2. **Mobile View Recalculations**: The `isMobileView` calculation was being recalculated frequently
3. **Object Reference Changes**: The `activeFilters` object was being recreated on every render
4. **Cascading Updates**: Changes in one dependency were triggering updates in others

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Stabilized Mobile View Calculation

**File: `frontend/app/eatery/EateryPageClient.tsx`**

- Removed `isMobile` dependency from `isMobileView` useMemo to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- The `isMobile` value from `useMobileOptimization` hook was changing frequently

```typescript
// Before (problematic)
const isMobileView = useMemo(() => {
  // ... calculation logic
}, [isHydrated, viewportWidth, isMobile]); // isMobile was changing frequently

// After (fixed)
const isMobileView = useMemo(() => {
  // ... calculation logic
}, [isHydrated, viewportWidth]); // Removed isMobile dependency
```

### 2. Stabilized Active Filters

**File: `frontend/app/eatery/EateryPageClient.tsx`**

- Added `stableActiveFilters` using useMemo to prevent object reference changes
- Only updates when actual filter values change, not on every render

```typescript
// Stabilize activeFilters to prevent unnecessary re-renders
const stableActiveFilters = useMemo(() => activeFilters, [
  activeFilters.category,
  activeFilters.agency,
  activeFilters.nearMe,
  activeFilters.maxDistanceMi,
  activeFilters.ratingMin,
  activeFilters.priceRange,
  activeFilters.dietary
]);
```

### 3. Updated Main Fetch useEffect Dependencies

**File: `frontend/app/eatery/EateryPageClient.tsx`**

- Changed dependency from `activeFilters` to `stableActiveFilters`
- This prevents the useEffect from running when only the object reference changes

```typescript
// Before (problematic)
}, [searchQuery, activeFilters, currentPage, useCursorMode, effectiveInfiniteScrollMode, loading, isRequestThrottled]);

// After (fixed)
}, [searchQuery, stableActiveFilters, currentPage, useCursorMode, effectiveInfiniteScrollMode, loading, isRequestThrottled]);
```

### 4. Added Debug Logging

**File: `frontend/app/eatery/EateryPageClient.tsx`**

- Added comprehensive logging to identify which dependency triggers the effect
- Helps debug future infinite loop issues

```typescript
// Debug logging to identify which dependency is causing infinite loops
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log('üîç Main fetch effect triggered:', {
    searchQuery,
    activeFilters: JSON.stringify(activeFilters),
    currentPage,
    useCursorMode,
    effectiveInfiniteScrollMode,
    loading,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}
```

## Performance Improvements

### Before Fixes
- Infinite loop causing continuous API calls
- Excessive re-renders due to unstable dependencies
- "Maximum update depth exceeded" error
- Page becoming unresponsive

### After Fixes
- Stable dependencies preventing infinite loops
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Stable filter object references
- Better performance and user experience

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test filter changes** - Ensure filters work without causing infinite loops
2. **Test mobile responsiveness** - Verify mobile view calculations are stable
3. **Test rapid interactions** - Ensure no infinite loops on rapid user actions
4. **Monitor console logs** - Check debug logs for any remaining issues
5. **Test different screen sizes** - Verify mobile/desktop switching works correctly

## Future Prevention

1. **Use stable references** - Always use useMemo/useCallback for objects/functions in dependencies
2. **Minimize dependencies** - Only include essential dependencies in useEffect arrays
3. **Add dependency validation** - Use ESLint rules to catch problematic dependencies
4. **Regular dependency audits** - Periodically review useEffect dependencies for stability
5. **Add performance monitoring** - Track render cycles and effect triggers

## Conclusion

These fixes address the root causes of the infinite loop by implementing:

- **Stable dependencies** through proper useMemo usage
- **Object reference stabilization** to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Dependency optimization** to minimize effect triggers
- **Comprehensive debugging** to identify future issues

The eatery page should now have stable performance without infinite loops or excessive re-renders.
