# Backend Issues

## `backend/routes/api_v4.py`

- **Error Handling:** The file has a lot of `try...except` blocks. While this is good for catching errors, the exceptions are very broad (`except Exception as e:`). This can hide specific errors and make debugging difficult. It would be better to catch more specific exceptions.
- **Fallback Logic:** There is a lot of fallback logic in case of `ImportError`. This makes the code harder to read and understand. It would be better to ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.
- **Circular Dependencies:** There might be circular dependencies between the services and the main `api_v4.py` file. For example, `create_restaurant_service` is called from `get_restaurants`, but `restaurant_service_v4` also imports things from `utils`. This could be a problem.
- **Hardcoded Values:** In `get_marketplace_categories`, there are hardcoded fallback categories. This should be avoided. The categories should be fetched from a database or a configuration file.
- **Security:** The `/admin/run-marketplace-migration` endpoint has a simple token-based authentication. This is not very secure. It would be better to use a more robust authentication mechanism, like OAuth2.
- **Code Duplication:** The `create_marketplace_tables` and `migrate_marketplace_tables` functions seem to do similar things. The code could be refactored to avoid duplication.
- **Readability:** The file is very long and has a lot of nested functions. It could be broken down into smaller, more manageable modules.

## `backend/routes/user_api.py`

- **Error Handling:** Similar to `api_v4.py`, the error handling is very generic. It catches `Exception` which is too broad.
- **Placeholder Logic:** Many functions have placeholder logic instead of actual database queries. For example, `get_user_favorites`, `get_user_reviews`, `get_user_activity`, `get_user_stats`.
- **Security:** The `update_user_profile` function allows updating any field in `user_metadata`. This could be a security risk if there is sensitive information in the metadata. It would be better to have a whitelist of updatable fields.
- **Validation:** The validation is basic. For example, in `add_favorite`, it only checks if `restaurant_id` is a digit. It doesn't check if the restaurant actually exists.
- **Hardcoded Values:** The `limit` in `get_user_favorites` and `get_user_reviews` is hardcoded to a maximum of 100. This should be configurable.
