# Rollback Plan for Marketplace Migration
Generated on: 2025-08-18T21:03:15.981833

## Rollback Steps

### 1. Database Rollback
If the marketplace table needs to be removed:
```bash
cd scripts/database
python rollback_marketplace_migration.py
```

### 2. Redis Cache Clear
If Redis cache needs to be cleared:
```bash
redis-cli FLUSHDB
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Revert any environment variable changes made for the migration.

### 4. Application Restart
Restart the application to clear any cached data:
```bash
# For Render deployment
# The application will automatically restart after deployment
```

## Rollback Triggers
- Database migration fails
- Redis configuration fails
- Production verification shows critical issues
- Performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds
