## 🔥 **CRITICAL PRIORITY (P0)**

### 1. **Feature Flags System** ✅
- **Priority**: P0 (Critical)
- **Issue**: `API_V4_REVIEWS=true` environment variable not being loaded properly
- **Impact**: Reviews endpoints may not function correctly
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `backend/utils/feature_flags_v4.py`
  - `backend/config.env` (line 129: `API_V4_REVIEWS=true`)
  - `backend/routes/api_v4.py` (lines 761, 815, 843, 867, 895)
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Investigate why `API_V4_REVIEWS=true` environment variable not being loaded properly
  - [x] Fix feature flag loading mechanism in `FeatureFlagsV4` class
  - [x] Test feature flag enablement via environment variables
  - [x] Remove temporary bypass code from `require_api_v4_flag` decorator
  - [x] Verify all API v4 endpoints work with proper feature flag system
  - [x] Update documentation to reflect proper feature flag usage
- **Notes**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Fixed environment variable loading from config.env file. The issue was in the environment variable name construction which was creating double prefixes (e.g., `API_V4_API_V4_ENABLED` instead of `API_V4_ENABLED`). Now properly loads `API_V4_ENABLED=true` and `API_V4_REVIEWS=true` from config.env.

  - `backend/routes/api_v4.py:1081`
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Replace placeholder sessions with Supabase session in ReviewsSection
  - [x] Replace placeholder sessions with Supabase session in ReviewsModal
  - [x] Integrate Supabase auth in marketplace seller functionality
  - [x] Test authentication flow across all components
- **Implementation Details**:
  - ✅ Created `backend/utils/supabase_auth.py` with JWT verification utilities
  - ✅ Added `@require_supabase_auth` decorator to marketplace POST endpoint
  - ✅ Added PUT and DELETE endpoints for marketplace listings with authentication

## 🧹 Codebase Cleanup & Next Steps

### 1) Database Migrations & Seeding (P1)
- [ ] Apply DB tables for marketplace entities (orders/messages/vendor mapping)
  - File refs: `frontend/prisma/schema.prisma`, `frontend/prisma/migrations/20250902_add_marketplace_entities/README.md`
  - Rollback: drop the three tables (notes in README)
- [ ] Seed `vendor_admins` with mappings for store_admin test users
- [ ] Regenerate Prisma client after applying schema changes

### 2) Environment & Runtime (P1)
- [ ] Configure Redis caching envs: `REDIS_URL` (or host/port/password/db), `CACHE_ENABLED=true`, `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=300`, `CACHE_PREFIX=jewgo:cache:`
- [ ] Configure health provider envs: `HEALTH_PROVIDER` + provider keys (Sentry/Datadog/Upstash)
- [ ] Confirm SSE proxy settings (disable buffering, increase timeouts)

### 3) Store Admin Ownership & API Surface (P1)
- [ ] Enforce vendor ownership on all store_admin endpoints (beyond metrics)
- [ ] Auto-scope store_admin when single vendor mapping exists (done for metrics; replicate for other endpoints)
- [ ] Add dedicated product/order/message mutation routes with ownership checks
- [ ] Call `invalidateVendorCaches(vendorId)` on successful mutations

### 4) Caching & Invalidation (P1)
- [ ] Document cache keys and versioning strategy (`jewgo:v1:cache:`) to enable future schema changes
- [ ] Add invalidation hooks in any remaining write endpoints affecting dashboard/store metrics
- [ ] Optional: add Redis pub/sub channel `jewgo:cache:invalidate` for multi-instance cache busting

### 5) Monitoring & Health (P2)
- [ ] Refine Sentry/Datadog queries to target our tagged services and compute precise error rate
- [ ] Add simple error budget and uptime rollups to dashboard health

### 6) Testing & Quality (P2)
- [ ] Add unit tests for RBAC (roleLevel/isSuperAdmin/permissions), caching helpers, and metrics endpoints
- [ ] Add integration tests for audit SSE fallback to polling
- [ ] Add load tests for metrics endpoints within 90s budget

### 7) Cleanup & Consistency (P2)
- [ ] Run unused files scanner and remove/confirm items; update docs accordingly
- [ ] Normalize permission constant usage (prefer `lib/server/admin-constants` on server, `lib/constants/permissions` for types)
- [ ] Add ADR documenting admin dashboard architecture and caching (see `docs/adr/`)

  - [x] **Tiered Plans System** - Subscription-based store plans
    - [x] Implement Free/Basic/Premium plan structure
    - [x] Add plan limits (products, images, messages, analytics retention)

### **Feature Flags System Fix** ✅
- **Status**: Completed
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Issue**: Environment variables `API_V4_ENABLED=true` and `API_V4_REVIEWS=true` not being loaded properly from config.env
- **Root Cause**: Environment variable name construction was creating double prefixes (e.g., `API_V4_API_V4_ENABLED` instead of `API_V4_ENABLED`)
- **Solution**: Fixed the `_load_from_env` method in `backend/utils/feature_flags_v4.py` to properly construct environment variable names by removing the `api_v4_` prefix from flag names
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/utils/feature_flags_v4.py` - Fixed environment variable loading
