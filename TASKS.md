    - ‚úÖ Design: `plans/DES_specials_system.md` - Database schema with lookup tables, GiST indexes, and materialized views
    - ‚úÖ Implementation: `plans/IMP_specials_system.md` - Migration strategy and rollback plan
    - ‚úÖ Database Migration: `backend/database/migrations/create_specials_system.py` - Complete schema with constraints

* [ ] OAuth Error Analysis ‚Äî investigate OAuth failure patterns and authentication flow

  * Status: working
  * Notes: User experiencing OAuth failures with error code `oauth_failed` and auth token clearing. Analysis completed.
    - OAuth error flow: Backend redirects to `/auth/error?error=oauth_failed` from multiple failure points in `backend/routes/v5/oauth_google.py`
    - Error page: `frontend/app/auth/error/AuthErrorHandler.tsx` logs detailed debug info and provides session clearing
    - Auth sync: `frontend/lib/auth/postgres-auth.ts` calls `/sync-user` endpoint to validate tokens
    - Token clearing: When sync-user returns `authenticated: false` and `guest: undefined`, tokens are cleared automatically
    - Root cause: In some environments, missing DB column `oauth_states_v5.extra_data` caused callback failures. Hotfix added; migration available.
    - Monitoring: Error details are logged with debug info including error_code, timestamp, url_params, and user_agent
    - üìÑ Requirements: `plans/REQ_google_oauth_state_fix.md`
    - üìÑ Design: `plans/DES_google_oauth_state_fix.md`
    - üìÑ Implementation: `plans/IMP_google_oauth_state_fix.md`

    - ‚úÖ Fixed Docker build failure: Added linux-headers to Dockerfile.optimized for psutil compilation
    - ‚úÖ Backend container startup: Created comprehensive deployment fix script
    - ‚úÖ Nginx port conflicts: Script handles service conflicts and port cleanup
    - ‚úÖ 502 errors: Root cause addressed through proper container startup sequence
