# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive authentication security hardening for the JewGo platform to address critical security vulnerabilities and establish production-ready authentication infrastructure. The system will implement CSRF protection, secure token rotation, proper CORS handling, environment-aware cookie policies, and comprehensive security monitoring across both frontend and backend components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want CSRF protection implemented across all mutating API endpoints, so that users are protected from cross-site request forgery attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE request to any API endpoint THEN the system SHALL validate a CSRF token
2. WHEN a CSRF token is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response
3. WHEN a user requests a CSRF token via GET /api/v5/auth/csrf THEN the system SHALL issue a secure CSRF cookie using HMAC
4. IF a request includes valid authentication but invalid CSRF token THEN the system SHALL reject the request with 403

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want JWT token rotation with family-based revocation implemented, so that compromised tokens can be invalidated and replay attacks are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user refreshes their authentication token THEN the system SHALL issue a new JWT with a new JTI (JWT ID)
2. WHEN a token refresh occurs THEN the system SHALL store the previous JTI and associate it with the token family
3. IF a previously used refresh token is replayed THEN the system SHALL revoke the entire token family
4. WHEN a token family is revoked THEN all tokens in that family SHALL become invalid immediately
5. WHEN token verification occurs THEN the system SHALL check against revoked families and JTIs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to handle network failures gracefully, so that I don't experience infinite refresh loops or authentication errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token refresh fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with jitter
2. WHEN multiple refresh attempts fail THEN the system SHALL limit to maximum 2 attempts before requiring re-login
3. WHEN concurrent refresh requests occur THEN the system SHALL deduplicate requests using shared promises
4. WHEN refresh requests timeout THEN the system SHALL abort after 10 seconds with proper error handling
5. IF a 403 response is received THEN the system SHALL clear CSRF cookies and local session state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want environment-aware cookie and CORS policies, so that the application works correctly across development, preview, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in production THEN cookies SHALL be set with Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=None, and Domain=.jewgo.app
2. WHEN running in preview environments THEN cookies SHALL be host-only with SameSite=None
3. WHEN CORS requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate against exact origin allowlist from FRONTEND_ORIGINS
4. WHEN CORS requests include credentials THEN the system SHALL set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
5. WHEN preflight requests are made THEN the system SHALL return consistent CORS headers including HEAD method

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want comprehensive security headers and monitoring, so that I can detect and respond to authentication threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any response is sent THEN the system SHALL include security headers: X-Frame-Options=DENY, X-Content-Type-Options=nosniff, Referrer-Policy=no-referrer
2. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL emit metrics for login, refresh, CSRF validation with result labels
3. WHEN token verification occurs THEN the system SHALL track latency with p95 target of sub-120ms
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events with masked PII
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate headers and status codes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want secure API proxies that properly handle authentication, so that sensitive tokens are not exposed to the client.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are proxied THEN the system SHALL forward multiple Set-Cookie headers correctly
2. WHEN network errors occur in proxies THEN the system SHALL map errors appropriately while preserving status codes
3. WHEN authentication fails in proxies THEN the system SHALL handle 401/403 responses without exposing backend details
4. WHEN using Node.js runtime THEN proxies SHALL only use Node runtime where necessary for performance
5. WHEN proxy errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the frontend

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want rate limiting and infrastructure protection, so that the authentication system is protected from abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users attempt login, register, or refresh operations THEN Nginx SHALL enforce 10 requests per minute with burst of 5
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests with Retry-After header
3. WHEN in production THEN Nginx SHALL set proxy_cookie_domain to .jewgo.app
4. WHEN serving auth endpoints THEN Nginx SHALL set no-cache headers
5. IF admin endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL optionally enforce IP allowlist restrictions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want health checks and configuration validation, so that I can verify the authentication system is properly configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL report JWT key presence, CSRF secret configuration, and database connectivity
2. WHEN CORS configuration is checked THEN the system SHALL display the current origin allowlist
3. WHEN system starts up THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
4. WHEN configuration errors exist THEN the system SHALL fail startup with clear error messages
5. WHEN monitoring systems query health THEN the response SHALL be under 100ms p95

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for security features, so that authentication security is validated before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSRF protection is tested THEN tests SHALL cover both success and failure scenarios
2. WHEN token rotation is tested THEN tests SHALL verify family revocation and replay attack prevention
3. WHEN CORS is tested THEN tests SHALL verify preflight requests with credentials
4. WHEN proxy functionality is tested THEN tests SHALL verify multiple Set-Cookie header forwarding
5. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL validate end-to-end authentication flows

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want secure session management with the ability to revoke sessions, so that I can control access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view my account settings THEN I SHALL see a list of active sessions with device information
2. WHEN I revoke a specific session THEN that session SHALL become invalid immediately
3. WHEN I choose "logout all devices" THEN all sessions in my token family SHALL be revoked
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN I SHALL receive notifications about security events
5. WHEN sessions expire THEN they SHALL be automatically cleaned up from the database
