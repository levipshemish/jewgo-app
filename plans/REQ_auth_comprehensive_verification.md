# REQ: Comprehensive Authentication System Verification

## Problem Statement
The authentication system requires comprehensive verification across all flows including login/logout, token rotation, session management, OAuth/SAML integration, and security policies to ensure robust production readiness.

## Scope
- **In Scope**: Complete authentication flow testing, security verification, multi-device session management, automated testing suites
- **Out of Scope**: Authentication system redesign, new feature implementation

## Constraints
- Must verify against live server (157.151.254.18) using SSH access
- Cannot modify server configuration during testing
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing auth flows
- Testing must not disrupt production services

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Login/Logout Flow Verification
- [ ] Email/password login with correct credentials succeeds
- [ ] Invalid credentials are properly rejected
- [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts works correctly
- [ ] Remember-me functionality persists across browser restarts
- [ ] Logout clears all authentication tokens and sessions
- [ ] Session timeout works as configured

### 2. Token Management Verification
- [ ] Access token generation includes proper JWT claims
- [ ] Refresh token rotation works correctly
- [ ] Token blacklisting prevents reuse of invalidated tokens
- [ ] Token expiration is enforced
- [ ] CSRF tokens rotate properly on state-changing requests
- [ ] Cookie security policies (SameSite, Secure, HttpOnly) are enforced

### 3. Profile and Account Management
- [ ] Profile updates (name, email, phone) work correctly
- [ ] Password changes require current password verification
- [ ] Guest to email account upgrade preserves user data
- [ ] Email verification flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Password reset flow works correctly

### 4. OAuth/SAML Integration
- [ ] Google OAuth flow works correctly
- [ ] OAuth error handling redirects properly
- [ ] OAuth state parameter prevents CSRF attacks
- [ ] SAML flows work where configured

### 5. Session Management
- [ ] Multiple concurrent sessions are supported
- [ ] Individual session revocation works
- [ ] "Revoke all sessions" clears all user sessions
- [ ] Session listing shows accurate information
- [ ] Cross-device session management works

### 6. Security Verification
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] CSRF protection blocks cross-site requests
- [ ] Security headers are properly set
- [ ] Cookie security policies match expectations
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks

### 7. Backend Monitoring
- [ ] Authentication events are logged correctly
- [ ] Rate limiting events are captured
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are tracked
- [ ] CSRF warnings are logged appropriately
- [ ] System metrics show healthy authentication flow

### 8. Automated Testing
- [ ] pytest integration tests pass
- [ ] Cypress/Playwright end-to-end tests pass
- [ ] Performance tests show acceptable response times
- [ ] Load testing validates concurrent user handling

## Success Metrics
- All authentication flows work correctly
- Security policies are properly enforced
- Backend logs show no anomalies or errors
- Automated test suites pass with 100% success rate
- Performance meets baseline requirements

## Risk Assessment
- **High**: Authentication failures could prevent user access
- **Medium**: Token rotation issues could cause session problems
- **Low**: Monitoring gaps could hide security issues

## Dependencies
- SSH access to server (157.151.254.18)
- Backend services running and healthy
- Database connectivity
- Redis cache availability
- Testing tools and frameworks
