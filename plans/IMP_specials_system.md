# Implementation: Specials System

## Implementation Strategy

This implementation follows a minimal-diff approach, integrating with existing infrastructure while adding new functionality for the specials system.

## Files to Create/Modify

### Database Layer
- `backend/database/migrations/create_specials_system.py` ✅ **Created**
- `backend/database/specials_models.py` ✅ **Created**
- Update `backend/database/models.py` to import specials models
- Create `backend/services/specials_service.py` for business logic
- Create `backend/utils/specials_helpers.py` for utility functions

### API Layer
- `backend/routes/specials_routes.py` - Main specials API endpoints
- `backend/api/specials/` directory with blueprint structure
- Update `backend/app/api/__init__.py` to register specials blueprint

### Frontend Layer
- `frontend/types/specials.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `frontend/lib/api/specials.ts` - API client functions
- `frontend/components/specials/` directory for components
- Update restaurant detail pages to display specials

### Configuration & Documentation
- Update `backend/requirements.txt` if needed
- Create API documentation in `docs/api/`
- Update `TASKS.md` with implementation status

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Database Setup ✅ **COMPLETED**
1. ✅ Create migration script with all tables and indexes
2. ✅ Create SQLAlchemy models for specials system
3. ⏳ Run migration on development database
4. ⏳ Verify schema creation and data integrity

### Phase 2: Backend Services
1. Create specials service layer with business logic
2. Implement claim validation and limit enforcement
3. Add time-range query helpers
4. Create analytics event tracking service

### Phase 3: API Endpoints
1. Implement RESTful endpoints for specials CRUD
2. Add claim/redemption endpoints
3. Implement event tracking endpoints
4. Add proper error handling and validation

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration
1. Create TypeScript interfaces for specials data
2. Build API client functions
3. Create specials display components
4. Integrate with restaurant detail pages

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
1. Write unit tests for services and models
2. Write integration tests for API endpoints
3. Create API documentation
4. Update frontend component documentation

## Rollback Plan

### Database Rollback
The migration includes a comprehensive rollback function that:
1. Drops all specials-related tables in correct dependency order
2. Removes triggers and functions
3. Cleans up any remaining database objects

### Code Rollback
1. Remove specials routes from API registration
2. Remove specials models from imports
3. Revert any changes to existing files
4. Remove frontend components and types

## Risk Mitigation

### Database Risks
- **Risk**: Migration fails due to existing data conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Use IF NOT EXISTS clauses and proper constraint checking

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Time-range queries are slow without proper indexes
- **Mitigation**: Implement GiST indexes and materialized views as designed

### Integration Risks
- **Risk**: Specials system conflicts with existing restaurant queries
- **Mitigation**: Use separate table namespace and careful foreign key relationships

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test specials service business logic
- Test claim validation and limit enforcement
- Test time-range query helpers
- Test analytics event tracking

### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints with various scenarios
- Test database constraints and unique indexes
- Test materialized view refresh logic
- Test error handling and edge cases

### Performance Tests
- Load test specials queries under concurrent access
- Test claim process under high concurrency
- Validate index performance with large datasets

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Restaurants can create specials with all required fields
- [ ] Users can view active specials for restaurants
- [ ] Users can claim specials within configured limits
- [ ] Staff can redeem claims with proper validation
- [ ] Analytics events are tracked correctly

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Specials queries return results in <200ms
- [ ] Claim process completes in <500ms
- [ ] System handles 100+ concurrent claims
- [ ] Database indexes perform efficiently

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] All database constraints enforced correctly
- [ ] No duplicate claims possible
- [ ] Proper error handling for all edge cases
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)

## Deployment Considerations

### Migration Execution
1. Run migration during low-traffic period
2. Monitor database performance during migration
3. Verify all tables and indexes created successfully
4. Test basic functionality before full deployment

### Feature Flags
- Consider using feature flags for gradual rollout
- Enable specials display on subset of restaurants first
- Monitor error rates and performance metrics

### Monitoring
- Add monitoring for specials API endpoints
- Track claim success/failure rates
- Monitor database query performance
- Set up alerts for high error rates

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features (Post-MVP)
- Recurring specials support
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Special templates for restaurants
- Bulk special management tools
- Email notifications for specials

### Scalability Improvements
- Implement caching layer for active specials
- Add database read replicas for query performance
- Consider microservice architecture for high scale
- Implement event-driven architecture for analytics

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension (for TSTZRANGE)
- Redis for caching (optional but recommended)
- Existing user authentication system

### Internal Dependencies
- Restaurant model and data integrity
- User and guest session management
- Existing API infrastructure and patterns
- Frontend component library and styling

## Timeline Estimate

### Development Time
- Database setup: 1 day
- Backend services: 2-3 days
- API endpoints: 2-3 days
- Frontend integration: 2-3 days
- Testing and documentation: 1-2 days

### Total Estimated Time: 8-12 days

## Quality Assurance Checklist
