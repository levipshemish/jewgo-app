# Security Notes for JewGo App

## 🔒 Files with Sensitive Data (Now in .gitignore)

The following files contain sensitive environment variables, API keys, and credentials and have been added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits:

### Environment Setup Scripts
- `scripts/setup-server-env.sh` - Contains production environment variables
- `scripts/setup-server-env.sh.template` - Template version (safe to commit)

### Deployment Scripts
- `scripts/restore-database.sh` - Contains database credentials
- `scripts/server-setup-new.sh` - Contains hardcoded secrets
- `scripts/deployment/deploy-route-refactoring.sh` - Contains sensitive data
- `scripts/server/setup_new_server.sh` - Contains credentials
- `scripts/essential/apply_postgis_indexes.sh` - Contains database info
- `scripts/deployment/deploy-improvements.sh` - Contains sensitive data
- `scripts/utilities/quick_setup_new_server.sh` - Contains credentials
- `scripts/essential/run_migrations.sh` - Contains database credentials

### Documentation Files
- `docs/SERVER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Contains hardcoded credentials
- `docs/SERVER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Contains database passwords
- `docs/server/NEW_SERVER_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Contains sensitive data

### Docker Configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Contains database URLs and credentials
- `config/docker/docker-compose.backend-only.yml` - Contains sensitive data
- `config/docker/docker-compose.local.yml` - Contains credentials
- `config/docker/docker-compose.optimized.yml` - Contains sensitive data

### Log Files
- `deployment-logs/` - May contain sensitive information
- `*.deployment.log` - Deployment logs with potential sensitive data

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ Use `.env` files for local development
- ✅ Use environment variables in production
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files to git
- ✅ Use templates for documentation

### 2. API Keys and Secrets
- ✅ Store in environment variables
- ✅ Use secure secret management
- ✅ Rotate keys regularly
- ✅ Never hardcode in source code

### 3. Database Credentials
- ✅ Use connection strings from environment
- ✅ Use strong passwords
- ✅ Limit database access by IP
- ✅ Use SSL connections

### 4. SSH Keys
- ✅ Store in secure location
- ✅ Use proper permissions (600)
- ✅ Never commit to git
- ✅ Use key-based authentication

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### For New Developers
1. Copy the template file:
   ```bash
   cp scripts/setup-server-env.sh.template scripts/setup-server-env.sh
   ```

2. Edit the file with your actual values:
   ```bash
   nano scripts/setup-server-env.sh
   ```

3. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-server-env.sh
   ```

### For Production Deployment
1. Ensure all sensitive files are in `.gitignore`
2. Use environment variables for all secrets
3. Set up proper file permissions
4. Use secure secret management

## 🔍 Security Checklist

- [ ] All sensitive files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Environment variables used for all secrets
- [ ] SSH keys have proper permissions (600)
- [ ] Database connections use SSL
- [ ] API keys are rotated regularly
- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive data
- [ ] Production secrets are different from development

## 🚨 If You Accidentally Commit Sensitive Data

1. **Immediately** remove the sensitive data from the file
2. **Force push** to remove the commit from history:
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/sensitive/file' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```
3. **Change all affected credentials** (passwords, API keys, etc.)
4. **Notify the team** about the security incident
5. **Review git history** for other potential leaks

## 📞 Security Contact

If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact the development team immediately.

**Remember**: Security is everyone's responsibility. When in doubt, ask before committing sensitive data.
