# Task Completion Log

## 2025-09-16 — Create AGENTS.md (Repository Guidelines)
- ID: 2025-09-16-AGENTS-GUIDE
- Owner: automated agent
- Links: `AGENTS.md`

Reason Why — User requested a concise contributor guide tailored to this repository. REQ: generate AGENTS.md. DES: align with repo architecture and existing tooling. IMP: added AGENTS.md covering structure, commands, style, tests, security.

Change Summary
- Added `AGENTS.md` with:
  - Project structure for frontend/backend/docs/scripts/docker.
  - Build/test/dev commands (npm, pytest, docker-compose).
  - Coding style and naming conventions (Prettier/ESLint; Black/Ruff).
  - Testing conventions (Jest; Pytest markers/config).
  - Commit/PR guidance with examples.
  - Security/config notes (env, PostGIS, CORS).

Risks & Mitigations
- Doc-only change, no runtime risk. No secrets added. Content verified against `README.md`, `docker-compose.yml`, `frontend/package.json`, `backend/pytest.ini`.

Tests
- N/A — no code changed. Verified command paths and scripts exist.

Docs Updated
- New: `AGENTS.md` (Repository Guidelines).

## 2025-09-16 — Fix Duplicate CORS Headers in Production
- ID: 2025-09-16-CORS-PROD-FIX
- Owner: automated agent
- Links: `backend/app.py`, `backend/README.md`

Reason Why — Browser blocked auth requests with: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin header contains multiple values 'https://jewgo.app, https://jewgo.app'". Nginx and Flask-CORS were both setting CORS headers in production, breaking OAuth follow-up calls like `/api/v5/auth/profile`.

Change Summary
- backend/app.py: Disable Flask-CORS in production; keep it enabled (with credentials) for non-production.
- backend/README.md: Document production CORS handling via Nginx and dev behavior.

Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Removing Flask-CORS in prod could expose missing edge config. Mitigation: Nginx already includes CORS configs; health checks validate origins.

Tests
- Manual: Verify `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` appears once and equals `https://jewgo.app` on API responses from production.
- Confirm frontend can call `/api/v5/auth/profile` without CORS errors after OAuth.

Docs Updated
- backend/README.md — Added CORS Handling notes.

## 2025-09-16 — Add Analytics Sink Endpoint
- ID: 2025-09-16-ANALYTICS-SINK
- Owner: automated agent
- Links: `frontend/app/api/analytics/route.ts`, `frontend/README.md`

Reason Why — Frontend attempted `POST /api/analytics` and received 405 (Method Not Allowed) in production. A minimal sink endpoint prevents errors and noise until a real analytics provider is integrated.

Change Summary
- Added Next.js API route to accept `POST` (and `OPTIONS`) and return `204` without logging or storing payloads.
- Documented behavior in `frontend/README.md` and noted env vars for future provider integration.

Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Accidental data retention. Mitigation: endpoint discards payload, no logs.
- Risk: Unbounded traffic. Mitigation: can add rate limits or provider integration later if needed.

Tests
- Manual: Browser `fetch('/api/analytics', { method: 'POST', body: '{}' })` returns 204; no console/log noise; no 405.

Docs Updated
- `frontend/README.md` — Added Analytics section.

## 2025-09-16 — Codebase Cleanup and Organization
- ID: 2025-09-16-CODEBASE-CLEANUP
- Owner: Claude Sonnet 4
- Links: `AGENTS.md`

Reason Why — User requested comprehensive codebase cleanup following AGENTS.md guidelines. Systematic removal of temporary files, deprecated code, and unused documentation while fixing linting issues and organizing file structure.

Change Summary
- **Removed temporary test files**: 10 verification/test .txt files from root directory
- **Removed deprecated files**: `lib/utils/admin.ts`, `lib/admin/auth.ts`, `lib/auth/canonical.ts` 
- **Cleaned up deprecated functions**: Removed `sanitizeRedirectUrl` from auth-utils.ts
- **Fixed linting issues**: Fixed unused variables in magic page test and component
- **Cleaned up documentation**: Removed outdated ESLint progress reports and analysis files
- **Updated TASKS.md**: Simplified format, removed empty table structure

Risks & Mitigations
- Verified deprecated files had no imports before deletion. No runtime risk.
- Linting fixes maintain functionality while cleaning code quality.
- Documentation cleanup removes outdated information to prevent confusion.

Tests
- Frontend linting passes with 0 errors/warnings after fixes.
- No functional code changes that require additional testing.

Docs Updated
- Updated `TASKS.md` with cleaner format
- Removed outdated documentation files
- Maintained current and relevant documentation

Pre-Change Safety Checklist
- Reused existing code/config/docs: yes
- Smallest diff that satisfies acceptance: yes
- No secrets/PII added: yes
- No schema/API changes: N/A
- Avoided servers/builds/migrations: yes
- Tests/docs updated in same PR: yes (docs only)

## 2025-09-16 — Apple Sign-In Coming Soon Modal Implementation
- ID: 2025-09-16-APPLE-COMING-SOON
- Owner: Claude Sonnet 4
- Links: `frontend/components/ui/ComingSoonModal.tsx`, `frontend/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`

Reason Why — User requested to update the "Continue with Apple" button to show a "Coming Soon" popup instead of redirecting to the auth endpoint while waiting for Apple environment variables configuration.

Change Summary
- **Created reusable Coming Soon modal**: New `ComingSoonModal.tsx` component with accessible design, keyboard navigation, and backdrop blur
- **Updated sign-in page**: Modified Apple button to trigger modal instead of API redirect
- **Added modal state management**: Added `showAppleComingSoon` state to handle modal visibility

Risks & Mitigations
- No breaking changes to existing authentication flow
- Apple button functionality gracefully degraded until env vars are configured
- Modal is accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard support

Tests
- Linting passes with 0 errors for both modified files
- Modal includes proper accessibility features and keyboard navigation

Docs Updated
- Updated component with inline documentation and proper TypeScript interfaces
