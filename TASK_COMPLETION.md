# Task Completion Log

## 2025-09-16 — Create AGENTS.md (Repository Guidelines)
- ID: 2025-09-16-AGENTS-GUIDE
- Owner: automated agent
- Links: `AGENTS.md`

Reason Why — User requested a concise contributor guide tailored to this repository. REQ: generate AGENTS.md. DES: align with repo architecture and existing tooling. IMP: added AGENTS.md covering structure, commands, style, tests, security.

Change Summary
- Added `AGENTS.md` with:
  - Project structure for frontend/backend/docs/scripts/docker.
  - Build/test/dev commands (npm, pytest, docker-compose).
  - Coding style and naming conventions (Prettier/ESLint; Black/Ruff).
  - Testing conventions (Jest; Pytest markers/config).
  - Commit/PR guidance with examples.
  - Security/config notes (env, PostGIS, CORS).

Risks & Mitigations
- Doc-only change, no runtime risk. No secrets added. Content verified against `README.md`, `docker-compose.yml`, `frontend/package.json`, `backend/pytest.ini`.

Tests
- N/A — no code changed. Verified command paths and scripts exist.

Docs Updated
- New: `AGENTS.md` (Repository Guidelines).

## 2025-09-16 — Fix Duplicate CORS Headers in Production
- ID: 2025-09-16-CORS-PROD-FIX
- Owner: automated agent
- Links: `backend/app.py`, `backend/README.md`

Reason Why — Browser blocked auth requests with: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin header contains multiple values 'https://jewgo.app, https://jewgo.app'". Nginx and Flask-CORS were both setting CORS headers in production, breaking OAuth follow-up calls like `/api/v5/auth/profile`.

Change Summary
- backend/app.py: Disable Flask-CORS in production; keep it enabled (with credentials) for non-production.
- backend/README.md: Document production CORS handling via Nginx and dev behavior.

Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Removing Flask-CORS in prod could expose missing edge config. Mitigation: Nginx already includes CORS configs; health checks validate origins.

Tests
- Manual: Verify `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` appears once and equals `https://jewgo.app` on API responses from production.
- Confirm frontend can call `/api/v5/auth/profile` without CORS errors after OAuth.

Docs Updated
- backend/README.md — Added CORS Handling notes.

## 2025-09-16 — Add Analytics Sink Endpoint
- ID: 2025-09-16-ANALYTICS-SINK
- Owner: automated agent
- Links: `frontend/app/api/analytics/route.ts`, `frontend/README.md`

Reason Why — Frontend attempted `POST /api/analytics` and received 405 (Method Not Allowed) in production. A minimal sink endpoint prevents errors and noise until a real analytics provider is integrated.

Change Summary
- Added Next.js API route to accept `POST` (and `OPTIONS`) and return `204` without logging or storing payloads.
- Documented behavior in `frontend/README.md` and noted env vars for future provider integration.

Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Accidental data retention. Mitigation: endpoint discards payload, no logs.
- Risk: Unbounded traffic. Mitigation: can add rate limits or provider integration later if needed.

Tests
- Manual: Browser `fetch('/api/analytics', { method: 'POST', body: '{}' })` returns 204; no console/log noise; no 405.

Docs Updated
- `frontend/README.md` — Added Analytics section.

## 2025-09-16 — Codebase Cleanup and Organization
- ID: 2025-09-16-CODEBASE-CLEANUP
- Owner: Claude Sonnet 4
- Links: `AGENTS.md`

Reason Why — User requested comprehensive codebase cleanup following AGENTS.md guidelines. Systematic removal of temporary files, deprecated code, and unused documentation while fixing linting issues and organizing file structure.

Change Summary
- **Removed temporary test files**: 10 verification/test .txt files from root directory
- **Removed deprecated files**: `lib/utils/admin.ts`, `lib/admin/auth.ts`, `lib/auth/canonical.ts` 
- **Cleaned up deprecated functions**: Removed `sanitizeRedirectUrl` from auth-utils.ts
- **Fixed linting issues**: Fixed unused variables in magic page test and component
- **Cleaned up documentation**: Removed outdated ESLint progress reports and analysis files
- **Updated TASKS.md**: Simplified format, removed empty table structure

Risks & Mitigations

## 2025-09-16 — Apple Sign-In Coming Soon Modal Implementation
- ID: 2025-09-16-APPLE-COMING-SOON
- Owner: Claude Sonnet 4
- Links: `frontend/components/ui/ComingSoonModal.tsx`, `frontend/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`

Reason Why — User requested to update the "Continue with Apple" button to show a "Coming Soon" popup instead of redirecting to the auth endpoint while waiting for Apple environment variables configuration.

Change Summary
- **Created reusable Coming Soon modal**: New `ComingSoonModal.tsx` component with accessible design, keyboard navigation, and backdrop blur
- **Updated sign-in page**: Modified Apple button to trigger modal instead of API redirect
- **Added modal state management**: Added `showAppleComingSoon` state to handle modal visibility

Risks & Mitigations
- No breaking changes to existing authentication flow
- Apple button functionality gracefully degraded until env vars are configured
- Modal is accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard support

Tests
- Linting passes with 0 errors for both modified files
- Modal includes proper accessibility features and keyboard navigation

Docs Updated
- Updated component with inline documentation and proper TypeScript interfaces

## 2025-09-16 — Fix TypeScript and Syntax Issues for Vercel Deployment
- ID: 2025-09-16-VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT-FIX
- Owner: Claude Sonnet 4
- Links: `frontend/app/auth/magic/page.tsx`, `frontend/app/auth/error/page.tsx`, `frontend/app/auth/magic/MagicLinkHandler.tsx`, `frontend/app/auth/error/AuthErrorHandler.tsx`

Reason Why — Vercel deployment was failing due to Next.js build errors: "useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary" in auth pages. This is required for static generation and proper pre-rendering in Next.js 15.

Change Summary
- **Fixed /auth/magic page**: Split into server component with Suspense boundary and client component for search params logic
- **Fixed /auth/error page**: Applied same Suspense pattern to prevent pre-rendering issues
- **Created dedicated handlers**: `MagicLinkHandler.tsx` and `AuthErrorHandler.tsx` for client-side search params logic
- **Fixed ESLint warning**: Properly escaped apostrophe character in text content

Risks & Mitigations
- No functional changes to authentication flow, only structural improvements for Next.js compatibility
- Suspense boundaries provide proper loading states during client-side hydration
- All existing functionality preserved with better error boundaries

Tests
- Next.js build completes successfully with 133 pages generated
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- ESLint passes with no warnings or errors
- All authentication pages maintain existing functionality

Docs Updated
- Code includes proper component structure following Next.js 15 patterns

## 2025-09-16 — Update Shul Grid Card Mapping
- ID: 2025-09-16-SHUL-GRID-CARD-UPDATE
- Owner: Claude Sonnet 4  
- Links: `frontend/lib/types/shul.ts`, `frontend/components/core/cards/Card.tsx`, `frontend/components/core/grids/Grid.tsx`, `frontend/types/index.ts`

Reason Why — User requested updating the shul page cards grid mapping to follow a new ShulGridCard type specification with specific field mappings for synagogue data display, including proper subtitle mapping to rabbi_name and additionalText for computed distance.

Change Summary
- **Created new ShulGridCard type**: Added `frontend/lib/types/shul.ts` with ShulGridCard interface and RealShul schema types
- **Added transformation function**: Created `transformShulToGridCard()` with distance calculation logic using PostGIS/user location
- **Updated CardData interface**: Modified to support `string | null` for badge and additionalText fields
- **Enhanced Grid component**: Updated transformItem function to use dedicated shul transformation for dataType='shuls'
- **Updated type exports**: Added shul types to main types barrel export

Risks & Mitigations
- Backward compatibility maintained for non-shul card types (restaurants, marketplace)
- Existing CardData interface extended rather than replaced to avoid breaking changes
- Distance calculation gracefully handles missing location data with fallbacks

Tests
- All modified files pass linting with 0 errors
- Type safety maintained with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Transformation logic handles edge cases (missing rabbi_name, coordinates, etc.)

Docs Updated
- Added comprehensive type documentation in `frontend/lib/types/shul.ts`
- Updated types barrel export to include new shul types

## 2025-09-16 — Add Geocoding System for Shul Coordinates
- ID: 2025-09-16-GEOCODING-SYSTEM
- Owner: Claude Sonnet 4  
- Links: `backend/routes/geocoding.py`, `backend/database/database_manager_v5.py`, `backend/scripts/geocode_shuls.py`, `frontend/lib/utils/geocoding.ts`, `frontend/components/admin/GeocodingPanel.tsx`

Reason Why — User identified that shuls only have address data but no coordinates, preventing distance calculations. Requested adding a geocoding system to convert addresses to coordinates and save them in the database for distance calculations when location permissions are granted.

Change Summary
- **Created geocoding service**: Enhanced existing `backend/utils/geocoding.py` with Google Geocoding API integration
- **Added geocoding API endpoints**: New REST API routes for single shul geocoding, batch geocoding, and address validation
- **Extended DatabaseManagerV5**: Added methods for shul coordinate management (`get_shul_by_id`, `update_shul_coordinates`, `get_shuls_for_geocoding`)
- **Created batch geocoding script**: Standalone script `backend/scripts/geocode_shuls.py` for processing existing shuls without coordinates
- **Built frontend utilities**: TypeScript utilities for calling geocoding APIs with proper error handling
- **Added admin panel**: React component for triggering batch geocoding with progress tracking and results display

Risks & Mitigations
- API rate limiting handled with 100ms delays between requests (well under Google's 50 req/sec limit)
- Graceful fallback to zip/city display when geocoding fails or coordinates unavailable
- Dry-run mode in script prevents accidental database updates during testing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the system

Tests
- All files pass linting with 0 errors
- Script includes verbose logging and comprehensive error reporting
- Frontend utilities include proper TypeScript typing and error boundaries
- Database methods include proper transaction handling and rollback

Docs Updated
- Added comprehensive inline documentation for all new functions and APIs
- Script includes detailed usage instructions and command-line options
- Frontend utilities include JSDoc comments with usage examples

Follow-ups
- Set up GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY environment variable for geocoding to work
- Consider running initial batch geocoding on existing shul data: `python backend/scripts/geocode_shuls.py --limit 100`
