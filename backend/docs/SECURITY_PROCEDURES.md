## Security Overview

The JewGo application implements comprehensive security measures including:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with family-based revocation
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with strength validation
- **WebAuthn Support**: FIDO2/passkey authentication
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection and XSS prevention
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, and other security headers
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DDoS attacks
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information disclosure

## Security Procedures

### 1. Authentication Security

#### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters (configurable)
- Must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Cannot be common passwords
- Must pass strength validation

#### Session Management
- Access tokens expire in 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens expire in 30 days
- Token rotation on refresh
- Family-based revocation on reuse detection
- Maximum 10 sessions per user

#### Multi-Factor Authentication
- WebAuthn support for hardware keys and passkeys
- Step-up authentication for sensitive operations
- SMS/Email verification (configurable)

### 2. Authorization Security

#### Role-Based Access Control
- Hierarchical role system
- Permission-based access control
- Resource-level authorization
- Admin override capabilities

#### API Security
- JWT token validation on all protected endpoints
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Rate limiting per user and IP
- Request validation and sanitization

### 3. Data Protection

#### Encryption
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- JWT tokens signed with HS256
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit

#### Input Validation
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS protection with input sanitization
- Path traversal prevention
- File upload validation

### 4. Infrastructure Security

#### Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

#### Network Security
- CORS configuration for allowed origins
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- IP blocking and whitelisting
- Request fingerprinting

## Incident Response Plan

### 1. Incident Classification

#### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Data breach, system compromise, service outage
- **High**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation, data exposure
- **Medium**: Rate limit bypass, input validation bypass, information disclosure
- **Low**: Configuration issues, minor security warnings

### 2. Response Procedures

#### Immediate Response (0-1 hour)
1. **Assess the incident**
   - Determine severity level
   - Identify affected systems and data
   - Document initial findings

2. **Contain the threat**
   - Block malicious IPs if applicable
   - Revoke compromised sessions/tokens
   - Isolate affected systems if necessary

3. **Notify stakeholders**
   - Security team
   - Development team
   - Management (for Critical/High incidents)

#### Short-term Response (1-24 hours)
1. **Investigate the incident**
   - Analyze logs and monitoring data
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess impact and scope

2. **Implement temporary fixes**
   - Apply security patches
   - Update configurations
   - Deploy emergency fixes

3. **Communicate with users**
   - Notify affected users (if applicable)
   - Provide status updates
   - Document incident publicly (if required)

#### Long-term Response (1-7 days)
1. **Implement permanent fixes**
   - Deploy comprehensive security updates
   - Update security procedures
   - Enhance monitoring and detection

2. **Conduct post-incident review**
   - Analyze response effectiveness
   - Identify lessons learned
   - Update incident response procedures

3. **Document and report**
   - Create incident report
   - Update security documentation
   - Report to authorities (if required)

### 3. Incident Response Team

#### Roles and Responsibilities
- **Incident Commander**: Overall coordination and decision making
- **Security Analyst**: Technical investigation and analysis
- **Developer**: Code fixes and system updates
- **Communications**: User and stakeholder communication
- **Legal/Compliance**: Regulatory requirements and legal issues

## Security Monitoring

### 1. Automated Monitoring

#### Log Analysis
- Authentication failures and successes
- Authorization violations
- Rate limiting triggers
- Suspicious request patterns
- Error rates and types

#### Alerting
- Failed login attempts (threshold: 5 per minute)
- Rate limit violations (threshold: 10 per minute)
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Unusual traffic patterns

#### Metrics
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Session creation and revocation rates
- API response times and error rates
- Security header compliance
- SSL/TLS certificate status

### 2. Manual Monitoring

#### Daily Tasks
- Review security logs for anomalies
- Check authentication metrics
- Verify security header compliance
- Monitor rate limiting effectiveness

#### Weekly Tasks
- Analyze security trends
- Review user access patterns
- Check for configuration drift
- Update security documentation

#### Monthly Tasks
- Conduct security assessment
- Review and update security procedures
- Analyze incident response effectiveness
- Plan security improvements
