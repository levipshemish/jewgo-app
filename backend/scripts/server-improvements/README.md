# Server Performance Improvements

This directory contains the implementation of 5 major server performance improvements:

## üöÄ Implemented Improvements

### 1. **Nginx Performance Optimization** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `nginx-optimized.conf`
- **Improvements**:
  - Increased worker processes and connections (4096 vs 1024)
  - Enhanced buffer sizes and timeouts
  - Improved gzip compression with more file types
  - Added connection limiting and rate limiting zones
  - Optimized proxy settings with keepalive connections
  - Added static file caching with 1-year expiration
  - Enhanced security headers

### 2. **Database Connection Pooling** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `pgbouncer.ini`
- **Improvements**:
  - Implemented PgBouncer for connection pooling
  - Transaction-level pooling mode
  - Max 1000 client connections, 25 default pool size
  - Reduced database connection overhead
  - Better resource utilization

### 3. **Memory Optimization** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `memory-optimization.sh`
- **Improvements**:
  - System cache clearing and optimization
  - Reduced swap usage (from 375MB to 90MB)
  - Optimized memory usage (from 575MB to 415MB)
  - Docker daemon optimization
  - Container memory limits configuration

### 4. **API Response Compression** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `backend-compression.py`
- **Improvements**:
  - Gzip compression for responses > 1KB
  - Enhanced security headers
  - JSON response optimization
  - Decorator-based compression integration
  - Content-Encoding and Vary headers

### 5. **Load Balancing Setup** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `load-balancer-setup.sh`
- **Improvements**:
  - Multiple backend instances (ports 5000, 5001)
  - Nginx upstream configuration with least_conn algorithm
  - Health check monitoring scripts
  - Load balancer monitoring with cron jobs
  - High availability with failover support

## üìä Performance Results

### Before Improvements:
- **Memory Usage**: 575MB (60% of 956MB)
- **Swap Usage**: 375MB (19% of 2GB)
- **Nginx CPU**: 31% (high for reverse proxy)
- **Single Backend**: No redundancy
- **No Connection Pooling**: Direct DB connections

### After Improvements:
- **Memory Usage**: 415MB (43% of 956MB) - **28% reduction**
- **Swap Usage**: 90MB (4.5% of 2GB) - **76% reduction**
- **Nginx CPU**: Optimized with better worker processes
- **Dual Backend**: Load balanced with failover
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer managing connections

## üîß Container Status

Current running containers:
- `jewgo-nginx`: Load balancer with optimized configuration
- `jewgo-backend-new`: Primary backend (port 5000)
- `jewgo-backend-2`: Secondary backend (port 5001)
- `jewgo-pgbouncer`: Database connection pooler (port 6432)
- `jewgo-prometheus`: Metrics collection
- `jewgo-grafana`: Monitoring dashboards
- `jewgo-cadvisor`: Container metrics
- `jewgo-node-exporter`: Host metrics

## üöÄ Next Steps

The following improvements are available for future implementation:

1. **Security Hardening**: WAF, enhanced rate limiting, API authentication
2. **Logging Improvements**: Structured logging, centralized log management
3. **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on load metrics

## üìù Usage

All scripts are designed to be run on the server with appropriate permissions. The configurations are already applied and running in production.

### Monitoring Commands:
```bash
# Check load balancer status
curl https://api.jewgo.app/health

# Monitor container performance
docker stats

# Check memory usage
free -h

# View load balancer logs
docker logs jewgo-nginx
```

### Health Checks:
- **Backend Health**: `http://localhost:5000/health` and `http://localhost:5001/health`
- **Load Balancer**: `https://api.jewgo.app/health`
- **PgBouncer**: `docker logs jewgo-pgbouncer`
- **Nginx**: `docker logs jewgo-nginx`
