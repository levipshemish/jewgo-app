## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### High Priority
1. **Move admin/test API routes to development-only environment**
2. **Split large components** (`SmartSearch.tsx`, `AdvancedFilters.tsx`)
3. **Remove or rename generic pages** (`test/`, `demo/`, `health/`)

### Medium Priority
1. **Extract reusable logic** into custom hooks
2. **Improve type organization** in `/lib/types/`
3. **Consolidate similar utilities** in `/lib/utils/`

### Low Priority
1. **Add better documentation** for complex components
2. **Improve error handling** consistency
3. **Add unit tests** for critical components

## 📊 Current State

### ✅ Good
- Components are well-organized by domain
- Consistent index.ts files for clean imports
- Clear separation of concerns in most areas
- Backup files properly organized

### ⚠️ Needs Improvement
- Some components are too large
- API routes need better organization
- Some pages have generic names
- Some utilities could be better organized

### ❌ Issues
- Test/admin routes in production
- Large components affecting maintainability
- Inconsistent naming in some areas

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Create development-only API routes** for admin/test functionality
2. **Split large components** into smaller, focused components
3. **Improve page naming** for better clarity
4. **Add comprehensive documentation** for complex areas
