# Filter Refactor Summary: Apply-on-Click Implementation

## Overview

Successfully refactored the filter system to implement apply-on-click functionality with client-side data fetching, eliminating soft reloads and improving UX performance.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. New Filter Architecture

#### Core Components Created:
- **`lib/filters/filters.types.ts`** - Shared TypeScript types for filters
- **`lib/filters/serialize.ts`** - Stable serialization for SWR keying
- **`lib/filters/urlSync.ts`** - URL sync without navigation
- **`lib/hooks/useLocalFilters.ts`** - Local filter state management
- **`components/filters/AdvancedFilterSheet.tsx`** - New filter UI with apply-on-click
- **`components/products/ProductResults.tsx`** - Client-side data fetching with SWR
- **`app/api/restaurants/search/route.ts`** - New POST endpoint for filter-based search

### 2. Key Features Implemented

#### ✅ Apply-on-Click Behavior
- Filters update local state only until "Apply" is clicked
- No network requests while typing or toggling filters
- Single network request triggered only on Apply button click

#### ✅ Client-Side Data Fetching
- Uses SWR for efficient data fetching and caching
- Stable keys based on serialized filter objects
- `keepPreviousData: true` prevents flicker during updates

#### ✅ URL Sync Without Navigation
- `history.replaceState()` updates URL without causing page reloads
- URL reflects applied filters for sharing/bookmarking
- No server component re-renders from URL changes

#### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- Debounced typing (no network calls until Apply)
- `useTransition()` for Apply state management
- Memoized filter components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- SWR deduplication prevents duplicate requests

#### ✅ Enhanced UX
- Draft filter state with visual indicators
- Reset functionality reverts to last applied state
- Clear all filters option
- Loading states and error handling

### 3. Technical Implementation Details

#### Filter State Management
```typescript
// Local draft filters (not applied)
const [draftFilters, setDraftFilters] = useState<DraftFilters>({});

// Applied filters (trigger data fetching)
const [appliedFilters, setAppliedFilters] = useState<AppliedFilters>({});
```

#### SWR Integration
```typescript
const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(
  ['/api/restaurants/search', createFilterKey(appliedFilters)],
  fetcher,
  { keepPreviousData: true }
);
```

#### URL Sync
```typescript
// Update URL without navigation
syncFiltersToUrl(appliedFilters);

// Hydrate from URL on page load
const initialFilters = hydrateFiltersFromUrl();
```

### 4. API Changes

#### New Search Endpoint
- **POST** `/api/restaurants/search` - Accepts filter object in request body
- Supports all filter types: text search, categories, location, etc.
- Returns paginated results with metadata

#### Backward Compatibility
- Existing GET `/api/restaurants` endpoint still works
- New POST endpoint provides better performance for complex filters

### 5. Performance Improvements

#### Before Refactor:
- Every filter change triggered immediate network request
- Server component re-renders on URL changes
- Soft reloads felt sluggish

#### After Refactor:
- Zero network requests until Apply is clicked
- Client-side data fetching with SWR caching
- No server component re-renders from filter changes
- Smooth, responsive filter interactions

### 6. Testing & Validation

#### ✅ Build Success
- TypeScript compilation passes
- ESLint passes without errors
- Production build completes successfully

#### ✅ Core Functionality
- Filter typing updates local state only
- Apply button triggers single network request
- URL sync works without navigation
- Reset and clear functionality works correctly

### 7. Files Modified

#### New Files Created:
- `lib/filters/filters.types.ts`
- `lib/filters/serialize.ts`
- `lib/filters/urlSync.ts`
- `lib/hooks/useLocalFilters.ts`
- `components/filters/AdvancedFilterSheet.tsx`
- `components/products/ProductResults.tsx`
- `app/api/restaurants/search/route.ts`

#### Files Updated:
- `app/eatery/page.tsx` - Refactored to use new filter system
- `package.json` - Added SWR dependency

### 8. Dependencies Added

- **SWR** - For client-side data fetching and caching

### 9. Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Typing in filters does not refetch** - Local state only until Apply
✅ **Clicking Apply triggers exactly one network request** - SWR handles deduplication
✅ **No soft reloads** - Client-side data fetching eliminates server re-renders
✅ **URL sync without navigation** - `history.replaceState()` updates URL
✅ **Reset functionality** - Reverts to last applied state
✅ **Performance optimized** - Debounced inputs, memoized components, SWR caching

### 10. Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run comprehensive testing on filter interactions
2. **Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring for filter operations
3. **Optimization**: Consider virtualization for large result sets (>200 items)
4. **Documentation**: Update user documentation for new filter behavior

## Conclusion

The filter refactor successfully implements apply-on-click functionality with significant performance improvements. The new architecture provides a smooth, responsive user experience while maintaining all existing functionality and adding enhanced features like URL sync and better error handling.
