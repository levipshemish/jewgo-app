# Build Log Analysis - Docker Production Issues
# Date: 2025-09-11
# Issues Identified:

## 1. pip --user warnings
```
WARNING: The script gunicorn is installed in '/root/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
WARNING: The script flask is installed in '/root/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
```

## 2. PATH configuration issues
- Dockerfile.production uses `pip install --user` but PATH only includes `/root/.local/bin`
- Non-root user `appuser` doesn't have access to root's `.local` directory
- PATH mismatch between build stage and runtime stage

## 3. Version consistency
- gevent==23.9.1 is properly pinned in both requirements files
- gunicorn==21.2.0 is pinned
- All critical versions appear consistent

## 4. WSGI entrypoint
- wsgi.py correctly defines `app = create_app()`
- Procfile correctly references `wsgi:app`
- Dockerfile.production CMD uses `wsgi:app`

## 5. PYTHONPATH configuration
- Procfile: `PYTHONPATH=/app`
- Dockerfile.production: `ENV PYTHONPATH=/app`
- Both use absolute paths correctly
