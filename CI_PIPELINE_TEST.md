# CI/CD Pipeline Test

**Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Purpose**: Test CI/CD pipeline functionality after fixes  
**Branch**: test/ci-pipeline-validation

## Test Changes

This file was created to test the CI/CD pipeline functionality including:

### Pipeline Jobs to Test
1. ✅ **Frontend**: ESLint, TypeScript checking, build validation
2. ✅ **Backend**: flake8, black, pytest, coverage reporting  
3. ✅ **Integration**: Cross-system integration tests
4. ✅ **Security**: Bandit security scanning, npm audit
5. ✅ **Performance**: Lighthouse CI testing
6. ✅ **Governance**: Mendel Mode v4.2 validation scripts

### Fixed Issues Being Tested
1. **Missing temp_deprecated_check.js script** - Now created and functional
2. **Environment variable configuration** - Added Supabase variables
3. **Script permissions** - Made scripts executable
4. **Prisma generation** - Added to build processes
5. **Deprecated code warnings** - Fixed with proper dates

### Expected Results
- All CI jobs should pass successfully
- No missing script errors
- Proper environment variable handling
- Successful builds for both frontend and backend
- Security scans complete without critical issues
- Performance tests within acceptable bounds

## Context7 Confirmation
Context7 confirmed: no - This is a CI/CD testing change that doesn't require external library documentation consultation.

## Test Validation
This test PR validates that the CI/CD pipeline fixes are working correctly and all governance features are operational.
