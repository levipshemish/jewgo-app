You see unlike most upscale restaurants I visit, this one was very homey, with the authentic Israeli experience. You see the staff at the Friendship Grill are special needs children from Chabad\\u2019s Friendship Circle organization. These special children learn life skills, make friends, and are made to feel like they are a part of functioning society. It was for that reason that we drove out from Boyton Beach over 45min away. While the children only work there and in the Friendship Caf\\u00e9 next door from morning till 3pm, the place was full of pictures and information about the children. There was even a big screen with photos and captions as well as videos showing them off.  The man behind the grill and fryer, Tomer, a native Israeli, was telling us about how the kids help prep the food, stock the fridge and even take turns manning the cash register. Frankly, it was very inspiring. Tomer loaded our table up with the works. Plenty of piping hot pita bread, dips and salatim including; Carrot Salad, Beet Salad, Eggplant, Matbucha, Cole Slaw, and plenty of Chummus. Naturally we tried everything from the Falafel to the Shwarma and Schnitzel . We also got some delicious fries and sweet potato fries. Behind the restaurant is the Chabad House and Judacia Store. The food was really good and filling. The Falafel, crispy and golden brown on the outside and yummy, fragrant, and green on the inside. The turkey shwarma was juicy and soft, perfect when paired with some pita and chummus. For those that don\\u2019t want bread, they even had some rice and wrap sandwich. The schnitzel was really good. Crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside. Honestly, we couldn\\u2019t finish all the food. There was so much variety!  It\\u2019s a great place to eat and even better place to support.

The place has a nice vibe and the music is at a tasteful volume compared to the other kosher place right next door. A few other notes: at first it wasn't easy to find because there is no signage on top of the building like all the other stores. I know they aren't the only place that does this, and I understand why they do it, but personally I'm not a fan of the mandatory 20% tip. By definition a gratuity should be optional and variable based on the quality of the service. Without the ability to lower the percentage it doesn't exactly encourage good service (although in theory people could give more than 20% I assume people rarely do). And, because it's mandatory, what it really feels like is a psychological pricing trick where you're really paying 20% on top of the menu prices but you don't think about it when you make your selections. In our case the service was decent but not exactly stellar (we had the place to ourselves and it didn't seem like the staff was doting on us though they had nothing else to do). PS.

You see unlike most upscale restaurants I visit, this one was very homey, with the authentic Israeli experience. You see the staff at the Friendship Grill are special needs children from Chabad\\u2019s Friendship Circle organization. These special children learn life skills, make friends, and are made to feel like they are a part of functioning society. It was for that reason that we drove out from Boyton Beach over 45min away. While the children only work there and in the Friendship Caf\\u00e9 next door from morning till 3pm, the place was full of pictures and information about the children. There was even a big screen with photos and captions as well as videos showing them off.  The man behind the grill and fryer, Tomer, a native Israeli, was telling us about how the kids help prep the food, stock the fridge and even take turns manning the cash register. Frankly, it was very inspiring. Tomer loaded our table up with the works. Plenty of piping hot pita bread, dips and salatim including; Carrot Salad, Beet Salad, Eggplant, Matbucha, Cole Slaw, and plenty of Chummus. Naturally we tried everything from the Falafel to the Shwarma and Schnitzel . We also got some delicious fries and sweet potato fries. Behind the restaurant is the Chabad House and Judacia Store. The food was really good and filling. The Falafel, crispy and golden brown on the outside and yummy, fragrant, and green on the inside. The turkey shwarma was juicy and soft, perfect when paired with some pita and chummus. For those that don\\u2019t want bread, they even had some rice and wrap sandwich. The schnitzel was really good. Crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside. Honestly, we couldn\\u2019t finish all the food. There was so much variety!  It\\u2019s a great place to eat and even better place to support.

I was pleasantly surprised at the ample seating both indoor and out, with a cool and modern decor. We were seated immediately and started browsing the menu. We only had two hours till we had to leave so we decided to go light. Since we landed earlier in the day we started with a Caesar salad, the Chili Mix, Crispy Cauliflower and the Angus Beef Skewers. The food came quickly and we dived right in. Firstly, the Cauliflower was nice and crunchy and crispy, unlike the ones I tasted elsewhere. It was a pleasant surprise. They also had a little kick. The salad was fresh with a delicious dressing. The Chili Mix however, yummmmmm. My wife was skeptical when I ordered it, but after only one bite she was hooked. The chili which consisted of ground beef and black beans, cooked with chipotle peppers and served with Nacho Chips, \\u201csour cream\\u201d (vegan of course) and pico de gallo. I couldn\\u2019t stop eating it. Now lets talk about the Angus Beef Skewers. Wow! Soft flavorful meat on a skewer with some onions and peppers. The meat was so tender and juicy, I honestly could\\u2019ve ended the meal here. Naturally, I wanted to try just one entr\\u00e9e. I went with the Ribeye steak medium rare, which was grilled to perfection. It was soft and flavorful. The Ribeye also came with a side of fries. I also ordered one drink as I was on vacation, I ordered the Golden Margarita. It was the perfect way to end the night. Here is my summary. Great service, really good food, and VERY well priced. The whole meal with tax was just over $200. In the NY/NJ area, a meal like this would be at least double the price. We were also out within an hour and a half of just walking in.

This is mostly a tapas place so expect the portion sizes to be on the smaller side (they do have a limited selection of entrees). The place has a nice vibe and the music is at a tasteful volume compared to the other kosher place right next door. A few other notes: at first it wasn't easy to find because there is no signage on top of the building like all the other stores. I know they aren't the only place that does this, and I understand why they do it, but personally I'm not a fan of the mandatory 20% tip. By definition a gratuity should be optional and variable based on the quality of the service. Without the ability to lower the percentage it doesn't exactly encourage good service (although in theory people could give more than 20% I assume people rarely do). And, because it's mandatory, what it really feels like is a psychological pricing trick where you're really paying 20% on top of the menu prices but you don't think about it when you make your selections. In our case the service was decent but not exactly stellar (we had the place to ourselves and it didn't seem like the staff was doting on us though they had nothing else to do). PS.

The pitcher was almost empty, and as the server shook it to pour the remaining juice, more mold was disturbed and released into the juice.\\n\\nWhen I pointed out the black, slimy material floating in my juice, the server tried to dismiss it as pulp from \\u201cfresh juice.\\u201d I immediately asked to see the pitcher, and upon inspection, it was clearly contaminated with mold. It is unfortunate that I didn\\u2019t have my phone with me at the time, or I would have taken a picture of the pitcher to document the severity of the situation. The general manager refunded my order, but this is not enough to address the seriousness of the issue.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, when I opened the rest of my order in my car, I discovered that the muffin I had ordered was also moldy. This raises serious concerns about the overall cleanliness and food safety at this establishment. How many other customers have consumed mold-contaminated food or drinks?\\n\\nIt is unacceptable for any restaurant to serve food and beverages that could potentially harm customers.

This is the only Caribbean restaurant open on Sundays within reasonable delivery distance to my house. Out of the last 3 times I have ordered from this place, they have waited 20+ minutes, today almost 30 minutes to accept and then cancel the order. If you aren't open and cannot accept orders, don't open on the delivery apps. Simple. When people order food, they are trying to fit the delivery into their schedule. It is a pretty selfish and disgusting practice to accept, pick, and choose as a business when it comes in to people’s time. I am sure that the unintelligence that run this place thinks that if they don't make money off of the order, they have done nothing incorrect. However, and I speak for most people that use delivery apps. My time is worth more respect than Flavors gives its customers. I will be reporting this to Postmates since the driver was dispatched each time.\\n\\nYou people really need to learn how to run a business.
